transcript: "<p><span m='7550'> After flipping a coin 100 times, you tally up 42 heads\
  \ and 58 tails. You expected a 50/50</span> <span m='18010'>distribution. Does this\
  \ mean the coin is unfair?</span> <span m='22430'>This video is part of the Probability\
  \ and Statistics video series. Many events and phenomena</span> <span m='29810'>are\
  \ probabilistic. Engineers, designers, and architects often use probability distributions</span>\
  \ <span m='38110'>to predict system behavior.</span> <span m='41780'>Hi, my name\
  \ is Lourdes Aleman, and I am a research scientist in the HHMI Education Group</span>\
  \ <span m='49120'>in the biology department at MIT. I also work in the MIT Office\
  \ of Educational Innovation</span> <span m='56750'>and Technology. I helped develop\
  \ the Star Genetics software featured in this video.</span> <span m='64879'>Before\
  \ watching this video, you should know what a probability distribution is and be</span>\
  \ <span m='71500'>familiar with basic genetics vocabulary including genotype, phenotype,\
  \ homozygous, and heterozygous.</span> <span m='82000'>You should also know how\
  \ to use Punnett squares to predict the expected results of Mendelian</span> <span\
  \ m='88770'>crosses.</span> <span m='91340'>After watching this video, you will\
  \ be able to apply Chi square hypothesis testing to</span> <span m='97600'>experimental\
  \ data obtained from genetic experiments.</span> <span m='107240'>Going back to\
  \ question of whether or not our coin is fair, it turns out there is a statistical</span>\
  \ <span m='114110'>tool that can help us. Statistical tests can be used to determine\
  \ if sample data can be</span> <span m='122590'>assumed to come from a population\
  \ that has a certain distribution.</span> <span m='127950'>Today, we will use a\
  \ statistical test called the Chi Square Test for Goodness of Fit.</span> <span\
  \ m='139030'>The Chi Square test is used to analyze categorical data. In other words,\
  \ the test compares a</span> <span m='148370'>sample of data collected about an\
  \ event to expected values.</span> <span m='155380'>In our coin-flipping example,\
  \ our categories are heads and tails. An event is one coin flip.</span> <span m='167000'>Our\
  \ sample is 100 events.</span> <span m='171940'>We expect that the coin should have\
  \ a 50/50 chance of</span> <span m='176819'>being heads or tails in any given event.\
  \ The question we are trying to answer is \u2013 does</span> <span m='185480'>our\
  \ sample come from the 50/50 population distribution we expect?</span> <span m='193950'>What\
  \ we have just done is state our null hypothesis about the coin flipping experiment.\
  \ The Chi</span> <span m='202160'>square statistic tests this null hypothesis.</span>\
  \ <span m='207100'>We also need to state an alternative hypothesis. The alternative\
  \ hypothesis is simply that</span> <span m='214840'>the data do not come from the\
  \ specified 50/50 population distribution.</span> <span m='223200'>Before we can\
  \ test our hypothesis, we need to calculate a Chi square statistic.</span> <span\
  \ m='231600'>This statistic measures the discrepancy between observed counts and\
  \ expected counts.</span> <span m='241200'>Each term in our summation finds the\
  \ deviation, or error, between observed and expected values</span> <span m='249790'>for\
  \ each category. This deviation is squared to obtain positive values. Otherwise,\
  \ everything</span> <span m='260269'>would sum to zero because both our observed\
  \ and expected outcomes sum to the same value.</span> <span m='269820'>Each term\
  \ in the summation is divided by the expected value of the outcome as a way of</span>\
  \ <span m='276729'>normalizing each difference.</span> <span m='280729'>The Chi\
  \ square statistic lives in a distribution. This is the Chi square distribution\
  \ for any</span> <span m='289229'>sample that has two categories of data, or, in\
  \ other words, one degree of freedom.</span> <span m='298840'>If the outcome of\
  \ an event can only fall into one of two categories, we only need to know</span>\
  \ <span m='307229'>how many events fell into one category in order to determine\
  \ how many fell into the</span> <span m='314499'>other category.</span> <span m='318460'>The\
  \ Chi square distribution is actually a set of distributions, each for a different</span>\
  \ <span m='325490'>number of degrees of freedom.</span> <span m='329909'>If we look\
  \ at these distributions, the x-axis is chi-squared values and the y-axis is relative</span>\
  \ <span m='339249'>frequency. You might also notice that these distributions are\
  \ positively skewed. This</span> <span m='349169'>makes sense for a couple of reasons:</span>\
  \ <span m='352430'>The Chi squared statistic is always positive. Larger and larger\
  \ Chi squared values indicate</span> <span m='360589'>larger discrepancies between\
  \ observed and expected values. While possible, these large</span> <span m='368319'>discrepancies\
  \ are less probable if the null hypothesis is true. If we calculate the Chi</span>\
  \ <span m='377949'>square test statistic for the coin flipping experiment, we get\
  \ 2.56.</span> <span m='386400'>How do we interpret this number? First, we need\
  \ to look at the appropriate Chi-squared distribution.</span> <span m='396460'>In\
  \ the coin flipping experiment, there are two possible outcomes: heads or tails.</span>\
  \ <span m='404860'>If we know how many heads were flipped, we can calculate the\
  \ number of tails flipped.</span> <span m='412060'>So, we only have one degree of\
  \ freedom.</span> <span m='417159'>Let\u2019s refer to the Chi square distributions\
  \ for one degree of freedom.</span> <span m='423979'>We can compare our test statistic\
  \ to the distribution to see if we have support for our null hypothesis</span> <span\
  \ m='432379'>or if we need to reject it.</span> <span m='436789'>What will our criterion\
  \ for support or rejection of our null hypothesis be?</span> <span m='444260'>While\
  \ this is a fairly arbitrary choice, in many fields, a result is said to not differ\
  \ significantly</span> <span m='453219'>from expectations if it has a 1 in 20 chance\
  \ of happening.</span> <span m='460050'>In other words, if the difference between\
  \ the observed result and the expected result</span> <span m='466308'>is small enough,\
  \ we would expect to see it 1 in 20 times, which is a probability of 0.05.</span>\
  \ <span m='477920'>This probability is called the level of significance.</span>\
  \ <span m='483210'>If a Chi square value has a probability of occurring that is\
  \ greater than our level of</span> <span m='488919'>significance, it lends support\
  \ to our null hypothesis. If a Chi square value has a probability</span> <span m='498490'>of\
  \ occurring that is less than our level of significance, we should reject the null\
  \ hypothesis.</span> <span m='507140'>Using the Chi square distribution for 1 degree\
  \ of freedom, a chi square value of 2.56 has</span> <span m='515130'>a greater than\
  \ the 5% probability of occurring that we had set as our minimum.</span> <span m='522969'>This\
  \ means that we fail to reject our null hypothesis. In other words, what we observe</span>\
  \ <span m='529190'>is close enough to what we expect that we have confidence that\
  \ our coin is fair.</span> <span m='540620'>Now, suppose you are planning an experiment\
  \ where you will cross mutant flies that are</span> <span m='546660'>heterozygous\
  \ for a wingless phenotype to each other. The wingless phenotype is dominant</span>\
  \ <span m='554690'>relative to the wild-type winged phenotype. Let\u2019s use the\
  \ notation Gg for the genotype</span> <span m='564730'>of the parent mutant flies.</span>\
  \ <span m='567839'>In this case, the wild type, winged flies, are homozygous recessive.</span>\
  \ <span m='574980'>What percentage of flies resulting from a cross of two heterozygous\
  \ wingless mutants</span> <span m='582220'>would you expect to be wild type versus\
  \ mutant? Pause the video here and use a Punnett square</span> <span m='590779'>to\
  \ justify your answer.</span> <span m='599980'>Performing this cross using a Punnett\
  \ square, you would expect a 3:1 ratio of mutant to</span> <span m='608620'>wild-type\
  \ flies.</span> <span m='610850'>You perform the cross with the parental mutant\
  \ flies. The cross produces 50 progeny. 32 are</span> <span m='620560'>mutant and\
  \ 18 are wild type.</span> <span m='624170'>So, only 64% of our flies are mutant,\
  \ even though you expected 75% of them to be mutant.</span> <span m='635720'>Although\
  \ it is not what you expected, it doesn\u2019t seem that far off either.</span>\
  \ <span m='642449'>You decide to continue mating your parental mutant flies until\
  \ you have 1000 progeny.</span> <span m='649170'>Surely, with this large a sample\
  \ size, the ratio of mutant to wild type flies will be</span> <span m='655399'>closer\
  \ to what you expect.</span> <span m='658580'>Voila. Oh, wait a minute. Even with\
  \ a 1000 progeny, our experiments still produce 68%</span> <span m='668269'>mutant\
  \ and 32% wildtype flies.</span> <span m='672600'>Now you are really starting to\
  \ wonder if you can call this result \u201Cclose enough\u201D to</span> <span m='678310'>the\
  \ expected outcome. We can use the Chi-square test to evaluate the hypothesis that\
  \ the observed</span> <span m='689850'>ratio of 68:32 is the same as the expected\
  \ ratio of 3:1.</span> <span m='697269'>Pause the video here, calculate the Chi\
  \ square test statistic, and determine the degrees</span> <span m='703410'>of freedom\
  \ in your data.</span> <span m='711769'>You should have obtained 29.2 for your Chi\
  \ square value.</span> <span m='719860'>Because there are only two phenotypic outcomes\
  \ for your cross, there is only one degree of</span> <span m='726170'>freedom. Any\
  \ fly that isn\u2019t a mutant is wild type and vice versa.</span> <span m='733899'>The\
  \ Chi square distribution can also be presented in tabular form. If you look at\
  \ this table,</span> <span m='742329'>our experiment with one degree of freedom\
  \ and a Chi square value of 29.2 corresponds</span> <span m='751529'>to a probability\
  \ that is much smaller than 0.05. Do you have support for the null hypothesis</span>\
  \ <span m='762660'>or should you reject it? Pause the video here and take a moment\
  \ to think about it.</span> <span m='776460'>Because the ratio of progeny that you\
  \ obtained in your experiment has a probability of happening</span> <span m='783730'>that\
  \ is less than our level of significance, you should reject our null hypothesis.</span>\
  \ <span m='792139'>This indicates that our discrepant results are due to something\
  \ more than just random</span> <span m='797800'>chance. A multitude of other factors\
  \ could be contributing to our results. For example,</span> <span m='805949'>there\
  \ may be interactions with other genes that you are not aware of. Or, environmental</span>\
  \ <span m='812610'>factors could be playing a role. All we know is that our null\
  \ hypothesis of a 3:1 ratio</span> <span m='820860'>of mutant to wildtype flies\
  \ is incorrect.</span> <span m='827110'>As a next step, you decide to go back and\
  \ review your notes to see if you can formulate</span> <span m='833680'>another\
  \ plausible hypothesis.</span> <span m='837519'>Reviewing your Punnett square, you\
  \ expected to obtain this genotypic ratio in the F1 progeny.</span> <span m='845769'>If\
  \ you were to select a GG mutant from the F1 progeny and cross it with a gg wild-type</span>\
  \ <span m='855670'>fly, you would expect that all of the progeny would be mutants.</span>\
  \ <span m='861649'>After attempting this cross with a variety of flies from the\
  \ F1 progeny that have a mutant</span> <span m='869269'>phenotype, it becomes clear\
  \ that you cannot find a mutant fly that when crossed with a</span> <span m='876249'>wild-type\
  \ fly, produces all mutant progeny. Somehow, you keep selecting heterozygous mutants.</span>\
  \ <span m='887540'>You begin to suspect that the F1 population does not contain\
  \ the expected number of GG</span> <span m='895850'>flies!</span> <span m='897459'>Checking\
  \ your lab notebook, you see a note about an observation that you barely paid</span>\
  \ <span m='903800'>attention to at the time. When you mated the two parental mutant\
  \ flies, there were a number</span> <span m='910499'>of dead embryos in your vial.\
  \ A new hypothesis is forming in your mind.</span> <span m='918480'>Can you come\
  \ up with a hypothesis that may explain the observations you have made through</span>\
  \ <span m='924389'>these experiments? Pause the video here. Discuss and justify\
  \ your hypothesis with a classmate.</span> <span m='939480'>While there are many\
  \ possible hypotheses, one possible hypothesis is that the dead embryos</span> <span\
  \ m='947120'>in your vial were the missing GG mutants. It may be that the wingless\
  \ trait when homozygous,</span> <span m='956829'>results in lethality.</span> <span\
  \ m='958759'>This would result in a phenotypic ratio of 2:1 mutant to wild-type\
  \ flies in the F1 progeny.</span> <span m='972780'>Again, you can use the Chi square\
  \ test for goodness of fit to test your new null hypothesis.</span> <span m='982550'>Going\
  \ back to your data of 1000 progeny, use the test to evaluate the null hypothesis.</span>\
  \ <span m='992420'>Pause the video.</span> <span m='1000980'>You should have obtained\
  \ a Chi square value of 0.36. For one degree of freedom, you fail</span> <span m='1008249'>to\
  \ reject your null hypothesis.</span> <span m='1012220'>While you have support for\
  \ your null hypothesis, more experiments are needed to confirm the</span> <span\
  \ m='1018129'>idea that the GG genotype is lethal as you suspect. The results from\
  \ our Chi squared</span> <span m='1026990'>test have led us to a reasonable next\
  \ experiment to perform.</span> <span m='1036579'>In this video, you saw how the\
  \ Chi-square statistic can help us determine if our experimental</span> <span m='1044170'>genetic\
  \ data came from the expected population distribution. Comparing observed values\
  \ to</span> <span m='1053390'>expected values helped us determine if deviations\
  \ in our data could be explained by random chance</span> <span m='1062320'>or if\
  \ our hypothesis needed revision.</span> <span m='1067470'>The Chi-Square Test for\
  \ Goodness of Fit is just one statistical test of many that allows</span> <span\
  \ m='1074090'>us to determine how confident we are that a sample of data comes from\
  \ a population with</span> <span m='1080860'>a certain distribution. It is important\
  \ to understand what these tests mean and how to</span> <span m='1088420'>interpret\
  \ their results, so that you know their limitations and can make informed decisions.</span>\
