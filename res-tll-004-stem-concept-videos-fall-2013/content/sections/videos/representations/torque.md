transcript: "<p><span m='3770'> Here are two people. They're both standing, but they're\
  \ standing in two completely different</span> <span m='8020'>ways. Which person\
  \ would it be easier to push over? If you wanted to push this person [left]</span>\
  \ <span m='13530'>over, where would you apply a force? What about this [right] person?\
  \ The answers to</span> <span m='18199'>all these questions can be explained using\
  \ the concept of torque.</span> <span m='22380'>This video is part of the Representations\
  \ video series. Information can be represented</span> <span m='26510'>in words,\
  \ through mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D models. Representations are\
  \ used</span> <span m='32590'>to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding\
  \ of objects, systems, and processes.</span> <span m='38000'>Hi. I'm Sanjay Sarma.\
  \ Professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, In this video, we'll be</span> <span\
  \ m='44060'>talking torque and balance.</span> <span m='46820'>In order to understand\
  \ these core concepts, you'll need a working knowledge of vectors</span> <span m='51510'>and\
  \ their uses. Specifically, you must be familiar with force, displacement, and torque.</span>\
  \ <span m='57390'>We will also assume that you know how to compute a cross product,\
  \ and how to use the Right-Hand</span> <span m='62760'>Rule, and that you have done\
  \ problems involving the center of mass of an object.</span> <span m='68060'>Our\
  \ objective is to improve your ability to draw torque diagrams, and give you some\
  \ practice</span> <span m='73109'>with setting them up. By the end you should also\
  \ understand what is needed for human beings</span> <span m='78959'>to balance.</span>\
  \ <span m='81310'>We'll start with an activity. Everyone stand up and spread out\
  \ across the room. You'll</span> <span m='85959'>need a partner for this activity.</span>\
  \ <span m='88630'>When I say \"go,\" your goal is to carefully push your partner\
  \ over. Use the smallest amount</span> <span m='93908'>of force you can. You will\
  \ switch partners halfway through, so be gentle.</span> <span m='98380'>When you\
  \ push, consider where you should push, and in what direction. Try many different</span>\
  \ <span m='103899'>approaches.</span> <span m='105889'>Here are some questions that\
  \ may help you think about this in a scientific manner. When</span> <span m='110469'>it\
  \ comes to your push, where will you push?</span> <span m='113848'>What direction\
  \ will you push? How hard will you push? Consider your partner as well: how</span>\
  \ <span m='118908'>is your partner standing? What is the floor like under your partner's\
  \ feet? Can your partner</span> <span m='125090'>balance well?</span> <span m='127149'>Are\
  \ you ready? Go!</span> <span m='159220'>Switch partners!</span> <span m='191390'>Your\
  \ teacher will now lead you in a short discussion about this activity. Pause the</span>\
  \ <span m='196170'>video here.</span> <span m='204120'>Let's continue our investigation\
  \ of torque and balance in the human body. Take a look</span> <span m='208630'>at\
  \ this next video clip, in which MIT researchers Colin Fredericks and Jennifer French\
  \ demonstrate</span> <span m='215270'>the effectiveness of properly applied torque.</span>\
  \ <span m='218930'>[Colin speaking] This is called \"Sai son\" stance. This is a\
  \ basic stance in martial</span> <span m='224980'>arts. Known for it's stability\
  \ along a particular direction.</span> <span m='228870'>This is my colleague, mathematician\
  \ Jennifer French.</span> <span m='232210'>Jen knows the stance is strong along\
  \ certain directions\u2013such as the one she is pulling</span> <span m='236400'>in\
  \ now.</span> <span m='238120'>[laughing] Oops.</span> <span m='239850'>It can also\
  \ withstand a great deal of force in the opposite direction.</span> <span m='243370'>I'm\
  \ not going to be knocked over if she is pushing or pulling along that particular\
  \ line.</span> <span m='249980'>However, Jen knows the stance's weak point.</span>\
  \ <span m='254940'>If she pushes along a different line, it'll knock me right down\
  \ to the ground.</span> <span m='262199'>This isn't just martial arts. This is science.</span>\
  \ <span m='264879'>Torque controls my ability to balance and we're going to show\
  \ you how today.</span> <span m='268659'>[Sanjay speaking] To analyze the situation,\
  \ let's look at what physical properties are</span> <span m='274610'>important here.</span>\
  \ <span m='276550'>What forces do you think are involved? Pause the video to discuss.</span>\
  \ <span m='286340'>Next, draw a simple diagram that you can use to find the net\
  \ torque on this man. Pause</span> <span m='293199'>the video while you do this.</span>\
  \ <span m='301069'>The simplest way to represent this man is with a rectangle. You\
  \ should remove any other</span> <span m='305920'>details, and draw our forces so\
  \ that we can tell exactly where they are applied to his body.</span> <span m='312479'>Finally,\
  \ if you were to draw a diagram showing someone resisting a push, how would you\
  \ do</span> <span m='316900'>it? Which of these three is most appropriate?</span>\
  \ <span m='321129'>Pause the video to discuss.</span> <span m='328090'>You may be\
  \ wondering why we can use a two-dimensional diagram to discuss a three-dimensional\
  \ situation.</span> <span m='334129'>The reason is that all of our forces are applied\
  \ in the same plane, simplifying the problem.</span> <span m='340509'>While our\
  \ torque vectors point in and out of the screen on this diagram, we can represent</span>\
  \ <span m='345058'>that fairly easily. In a more complex situation, we may need\
  \ to draw something more fully three-dimensional,</span> <span m='351889'>as our\
  \ torques might point in other directions.</span> <span m='356389'>This next video\
  \ clip will walk you through a partial analysis of this situation. You</span> <span\
  \ m='362129'>will need a way to take notes and draw diagrams while you watch.</span>\
  \ <span m='370820'>[Jen speaking] I couldn't push Colin over by applying force in\
  \ the stable direction.</span> <span m='375379'>Yet when I applies the same force\
  \ in a different direction, I could push him over.</span> <span m='379740'>How did\
  \ I know this?</span> <span m='381340'>Torque.</span> <span m='382360'>Here you\
  \ see two 2-dimensional views representing Colin.</span> <span m='386759'>The width\
  \ of the base represents the distance between his feet.</span> <span m='389740'>The\
  \ wide square is the view of Colin from the side and stable states.</span> <span\
  \ m='392939'>The narrow rectangle is the view of Colin from straight on.</span>\
  \ <span m='396839'>Lets draw in the forces acting on Colin as I push him in the\
  \ stable directions.</span> <span m='401319'>Start by drawing the center of mass.</span>\
  \ <span m='403219'>Which we assume is at the center of the square.</span> <span\
  \ m='404999'>The force of gravity pulls straight down with magnitude three halfs.</span>\
  \ <span m='408529'>There is also the force of my push of length one. Which we place\
  \ in the location where</span> <span m='412990'>the force is applied.</span> <span\
  \ m='415360'>This push shifts Colin's weight entirely to his back foot. So the normal\
  \ force is applied</span> <span m='420759'>there with a magnitude equal and opposite\
  \ that of force p.</span> <span m='424210'>The force of friction is also at this\
  \ foot. Equal and opposite the magnitude and direction</span> <span m='428849'>of\
  \ the push force.</span> <span m='431240'>Recall that torque is r cross F.</span>\
  \ <span m='434339'>That is, torque occurs when a force is applied some displacement\
  \ distance from a reference</span> <span m='438210'>point.</span> <span m='439080'>We\
  \ can choose any reference point we like, and the net torque we compute will be\
  \ the</span> <span m='442729'>same.</span> <span m='443439'>For this problem I will\
  \ choose the reference point to be the pivot point.</span> <span m='446599'>Why\
  \ don't you try this problem but choose the center of mass as the reference point.</span>\
  \ <span m='450469'>Lets get back to the problem.</span> <span m='452550'>The push\
  \ force and the gravitation force are applied some distance from the pivot point</span>\
  \ <span m='456569'>at the foot.</span> <span m='457360'>So they will create torque.</span>\
  \ <span m='458869'>However, the friction force and normal force are applied at the\
  \ pivot point.</span> <span m='463150'>So R is zero and we can ignore that when\
  \ we compute the net torque.</span> <span m='467210'>Lets compute the torque due\
  \ to the push force.</span> <span m='469479'>The vector r is the displacement from\
  \ the pivot point to where the force is applied.</span> <span m='473279'>We decompose\
  \ this vector into its x and y components.</span> <span m='476580'>We use a coordinate\
  \ system with origin at the pivot point to determine the r vector</span> <span m='481520'>to\
  \ be 4i + 3j.</span> <span m='485900'>The magnitude of the push force is negative\
  \ one i.</span> <span m='492499'>The magnitude of torque can be found as the magnitude\
  \ of r times the magnitude of F times</span> <span m='497469'>sin theta.</span>\
  \ <span m='498219'>Where theta is the angle between the two vectors.</span> <span\
  \ m='500849'>Thus the magnitude is the area of the parallelogram formed by r and\
  \ F.</span> <span m='507619'>Since the area of this parallelogram is also the area\
  \ of the rectangle formed by F and</span> <span m='513750'>r sin theta or the component\
  \ of r that is perpendicular to F.</span> <span m='517890'>We can see this magnitude\
  \ visually as the area of this rectangle.</span> <span m='521289'>We will show the\
  \ magnitudes in this way because it is very easy to see the relative magnitudes</span>\
  \ <span m='526130'>of the various torques.</span> <span m='527790'>So...</span>\
  \ <span m='529200'>For the push force the area is 3, which mean the magnitude of\
  \ the torque is 3.</span> <span m='538290'>The direction of the torque vector is\
  \ along the axis of rotation caused by this force.</span> <span m='543020'>We find\
  \ the direction using the right hand wall.</span> <span m='545290'>Point our fingers\
  \ along r and curl along F.</span> <span m='549720'>In this case we find the direction\
  \ to be out of the board or positive k.</span> <span m='555430'>So this tells us\
  \ that the torque due to the push force is equal to 3k.</span> <span m='563050'>We\
  \ can also find the torque vector by taking the determinate of the following three\
  \ by</span> <span m='568200'>three matrix.</span> <span m='569990'>The first row\
  \ is i, j, and k.</span> <span m='573530'>The second row are the x, y, and z components\
  \ of the r vector.</span> <span m='578390'>And the third row are the x, y , and\
  \ z components of the force vector.</span> <span m='583060'>Because r and F lie\
  \ in the same plane, the z components are zero.</span> <span m='590060'>In our example,\
  \ the force is pointing in the negative i direction and r we found to be</span>\
  \ <span m='596180'>4 i plus 3 j.</span> <span m='597980'>Computing it this way,\
  \ we also find that the torque is 3k.</span> <span m='606090'>Now let's find the\
  \ torque due to gravity.</span> <span m='608490'>The vector r is found by connecting\
  \ the pivot point to the center of mass.</span> <span m='612080'>We leave to you\
  \ to pause the video and to determine the components of r using this coordinate</span>\
  \ <span m='617220'>system.</span> <span m='620830'>We find the magnitude of the\
  \ torque by taking the component of r that is perpendicular to</span> <span m='626540'>F\
  \ pointing in the x direction, and the magnitude is the area of the rectangle between\
  \ these</span> <span m='632600'>two vectors.</span> <span m='633850'>Again, we find\
  \ the direction using the right hand rule.</span> <span m='636880'>We find the torque\
  \ to be pointing into the board at the pivot point.</span> <span m='642530'>Since\
  \ the x component of the r vector is 2, and the force due to gravity is 3 halves,</span>\
  \ <span m='647940'>pointing in the negative j direction.</span> <span m='649830'>The\
  \ magnitude of the torque due to gravity is 3 and it points in the negative k direction.</span>\
  \ <span m='655020'>So the torque is negative 3 k at the pivot point.</span> <span\
  \ m='658600'>Adding the push torque and the gravity torque together we find that\
  \ we get zero.</span> <span m='664210'>This means that there is no rotation about\
  \ the pivot point.</span> <span m='668950'>Now let's look in the unstable direction.</span>\
  \ <span m='670890'>We have all the same forces as before- force of gravity at the\
  \ center of mass, the push</span> <span m='676450'>force, a normal force at the\
  \ back foot, as well as a friction force.</span> <span m='685080'>The magnitudes\
  \ of these forces are all the same as in the other diagram.</span> <span m='689910'>Let's\
  \ compute the torque due to the push force. The vector r connects the pivot point\
  \ to the</span> <span m='695370'>place where the force is applied.</span> <span\
  \ m='699110'>Using our coordinate axes with the origin placed at the pivot point,\
  \ we find this vector</span> <span m='704050'>to be i plus 3 j.</span> <span m='711300'>We\
  \ find the magnitude of the torque vector is the area of the rectangle formed by\
  \ force</span> <span m='715390'>vector and the component of r, perpendicular to\
  \ F.</span> <span m='719440'>Thus the area is one times three, or three.</span>\
  \ <span m='726070'>In order to find the direction, we use the right hand rule. Point\
  \ our fingers along r,</span> <span m='728830'>curl in the direction of F, and our\
  \ thumb points out of the board, so the direction</span> <span m='734090'>of our\
  \ torque is k.</span> <span m='736090'>Since the magnitude is 3, that tells us that\
  \ torque due to the push is 3 k at the pivot</span> <span m='741300'>point.</span>\
  \ <span m='742500'>Finally, let's find the torque due to gravity.</span> <span m='745670'>Start\
  \ by drawing the r vector from the pivot point to the center of mass.</span> <span\
  \ m='749620'>Now let's decompose this vector into it's x and y components.</span>\
  \ <span m='753320'>We leave this as an exercise to you, using the coordinate system\
  \ shown here.</span> <span m='762620'>The magnitude of the torque due to gravity\
  \ at the pivot point is found by the area of</span> <span m='766510'>the rectangle\
  \ form by the force vector and the x component of the r vector.</span> <span m='772570'>The\
  \ direction is found using the right hand rule, pointing our fingers along r and\
  \ curling</span> <span m='776500'>around F.</span> <span m='777800'>In other words,\
  \ into the board or negative k.</span> <span m='782260'>So the torque due to gravity\
  \ is one-half times three-halves or three-fourths pointing in</span> <span m='791680'>the\
  \ negative k direction.</span> <span m='794310'>The net torque about the pivot point\
  \ is the sum of these two.</span> <span m='797170'>In other words, the torque push\
  \ plus the torque due to gravity is the net torque around the</span> <span m='802200'>pivot\
  \ point, which is two and a quarter the positive k direction.</span> <span m='806550'>That\
  \ means there is a total net rotation about the pivot point. Causing Colin to fall\
  \ over.</span> <span m='816450'>We leave it as an exercise for you to use the determinate\
  \ in order to compute the torque</span> <span m='821550'>vectors.</span> <span m='822650'>If\
  \ you computed the net torque using the center of mass as the reference point, you\
  \ should</span> <span m='827090'>notice that the net torques that you found are\
  \ equal to the net torques that we computed</span> <span m='831680'>here.</span>\
  \ <span m='834840'>[Sanjay speaking] Now that you've seen torque and balancing in\
  \ detail, let's consider a</span> <span m='839940'>more complex problem. This one\
  \ is a bit tricky. I'll show you how it works.</span> <span m='844600'>I'm going\
  \ to take a chair and place it next to the wall.</span> <span m='847380'>I'll put\
  \ my toes up to the wall, and step back, toe-to-heel, twice.</span> <span m='853760'>I\
  \ step sideways until I'm over the chair.</span> <span m='857680'>Then I bend forward\
  \ until my head touches the wall, pick up the chair, and stand up...</span> <span\
  \ m='863520'>er... or not.</span> <span m='865690'>This is something that most women\
  \ can do, but men cannot.</span> <span m='870430'>Maybe you think it's a trick?\
  \ Here's a video of some of your professors trying to lift</span> <span m='877810'>[Jen\
  \ speaking]Okay, walk up to the wall.</span> <span m='879350'>Yes.</span> <span\
  \ m='879850'>Then heel toe heel toe.</span> <span m='881810'>That's it. One more\
  \ time.</span> <span m='883620'>And now translate over but don't come in or out.</span>\
  \ <span m='886860'>Okay.</span> <span m='887680'>Now bend over to the the wall.\
  \ Bend over. Put your head on the wall.</span> <span m='890740'>Mmm-hmm.</span>\
  \ <span m='891240'>Pick the chair up.</span> <span m='893560'>Now stand up.</span>\
  \ <span m='894770'>Hah!</span> <span m='895300'>[laughing]</span> <span m='901240'>That's\
  \ fair enough. Don't hurt yourself.</span> <span m='903180'>No, no. There was actually\
  \ no way. [laughing]</span> <span m='907320'>Toes against the wall.</span> <span\
  \ m='910980'>One.</span> <span m='912260'>Two. Okay, translate over. You might be\
  \ able to do it because his feet are proportionately</span> <span m='916400'>small.</span>\
  \ <span m='917740'>Okay, down.</span> <span m='919860'>Pick it up.</span> <span\
  \ m='921260'>[giggle]</span> <span m='923080'>Pick up the chair first. Please pick\
  \ up of the chair please.</span> <span m='926200'>Now stand up.</span> <span m='927720'>[laughing]</span>\
  \ <span m='931380'>Okay. One over.</span> <span m='933600'>Bend over.</span> <span\
  \ m='937380'>Ohhh, okay.</span> <span m='939880'>Alright.</span> <span m='941960'>Okay,\
  \ then do it one more time with the other foot.</span> <span m='945960'>Okay, now\
  \ can translate over a little bit? Just move over but don't go in or out.</span>\
  \ <span m='953500'>Well, no. You want a line there. Actually... be in a little.</span>\
  \ <span m='958320'>There you go.</span> <span m='959880'>No no no- you're fine!\
  \ Just even up your feet.</span> <span m='962000'>Okay.</span> <span m='962500'>Bend\
  \ over. Put your hands on the wall, just so you don't hit your head.</span> <span\
  \ m='965960'>Okay...</span> <span m='967560'>now pick up the chair.</span> <span\
  \ m='970320'>Now stand up.</span> <span m='972280'>No no. Don't do it again. You\
  \ have to pick up the chair. Clean pick up.</span> <span m='977100'>Now stand up.</span>\
  \ <span m='981200'>Alright! [clapping]</span> <span m='986880'>[Sanjay speaking]\
  \ Now it's your turn to try.</span> <span m='988520'>Get together with your partner\
  \ again and bring a chair over to the wall.</span> <span m='992480'>Why don't you\
  \ pause the video and give it a try?</span> <span m='1002020'>Now that you've attempted\
  \ the chair lift, let's return to our seats and discuss what</span> <span m='1005900'>happened.</span>\
  \ <span m='1007550'>If you wanted to figure out why this happens, what information\
  \ would you need?</span> <span m='1011990'>What assumptions would you have to make?</span>\
  \ <span m='1014690'>Discuss the matter with your partner. Try to draw a diagram\
  \ of the situation.</span> <span m='1019600'>Pause the video here while you work\
  \ this out.</span> <span m='1027060'>Many of you should be wondering about the center\
  \ of mass for this situation.</span> <span m='1031369'>This diagram shows typical\
  \ locations for the center of mass in men (on the left) and women</span> <span m='1037099'>(on\
  \ the right).</span> <span m='1038809'>Not only are men typically taller, but their\
  \ center of mass is usually higher in their</span> <span m='1042880'>bodies.</span>\
  \ <span m='1043970'>This is not always true, but it is fairly typical.</span> <span\
  \ m='1048309'>Using this information, work with your partner to try to explain what\
  \ is happening.</span> <span m='1053230'>Why can women lift the chair when men cannot?</span>\
  \ <span m='1057230'>You do not need to obtain a numerical solution.</span> <span\
  \ m='1060280'>Instead, use reasoned arguments, diagrams, and well-supported assumptions\
  \ to prove your</span> <span m='1065530'>answer.</span> <span m='1066910'>Only use\
  \ calculations if you cannot support your answer in any other way.</span> <span\
  \ m='1072690'>Pause the video and give it a try.</span> <span m='1079770'>Are you\
  \ ready to see the solution?</span> <span m='1081980'>Let's take a look.</span>\
  \ <span m='1084780'>For this section we will measure torques around the center of\
  \ mass.</span> <span m='1089030'>This will simplify our work so that we don't have\
  \ to worry about the person's mass and</span> <span m='1093280'>the pull of gravity.</span>\
  \ <span m='1095809'>This diagram shows the man lifting the chair.</span> <span m='1098590'>You\
  \ can see that the center of mass is outside his body, and has been moved farther\
  \ forward</span> <span m='1103050'>and down by the chair.</span> <span m='1105580'>This\
  \ diagram shows the same for the woman.</span> <span m='1107660'>Her center of mass\
  \ is also outside her body, but is much closer to her legs.</span> <span m='1114100'>If\
  \ we draw a line for the man to indicate where his toes are, you see that the center</span>\
  \ <span m='1119490'>of mass is beyond the edge of his foot!</span> <span m='1121820'>No\
  \ matter how hard he tries, he simply cannot apply force in the right place to lift\
  \ that</span> <span m='1127420'>chair.</span> <span m='1129290'>On our diagram,\
  \ we can see that the torque will always point in the direction out of</span> <span\
  \ m='1134180'>the screen.</span> <span m='1135170'>It will rotate the man counterclockwise,\
  \ pushing his head harder into the wall.</span> <span m='1140660'>The harder he\
  \ pushes, the worse it will be.</span> <span m='1144490'>The woman, however, has\
  \ her center of mass above her feet.</span> <span m='1148430'>She can stand up because\
  \ her feet are able to apply force in the proper location and</span> <span m='1153830'>direction.</span>\
  \ <span m='1154680'>If we draw a torque diagram, we can see that the direction of\
  \ torque applied by her feet</span> <span m='1162380'>will be into the screen.</span>\
  \ <span m='1164490'>By applying more force, she can rotate her upper body clockwise\
  \ and stand up, whereas</span> <span m='1169790'>the man cannot.</span> <span m='1172920'>Today\
  \ we hope that you have improved your ability to draw torque diagrams, and to analyze</span>\
  \ <span m='1177610'>torque problems that occur in the real world.</span> <span m='1181050'>Torque\
  \ is an important quantity that comes into play in countless situations around us,</span>\
  \ <span m='1185710'>from machinery to buildings to the simple act of walking. I\
  \ hope you enjoyed this look</span> <span m='1190660'>at one of its fascinating\
  \ applications.</span> </p>"
