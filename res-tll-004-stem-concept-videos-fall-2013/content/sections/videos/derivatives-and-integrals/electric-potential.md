title: Electric Potential
transcript: "<p><span m='4890'> Air is normally an insulator, but under certain conditions,\
  \ it can suddenly and temporarily</span> <span m='9920'>change into a conductor,\
  \ and we end up with a spark. In this video, we'll use the related</span> <span\
  \ m='15039'>concepts of electric fields and electric potential to explain how insulators\
  \ can suddenly, dramatically</span> <span m='21380'>and temporarily become conductors.</span>\
  \ <span m='24570'>This video is part of the Derivatives and Integrals video series.</span>\
  \ <span m='33150'>Hello. My name is John McGreevy. I am a professor in the physics\
  \ department at MIT, and today</span> <span m='43829'>I'll be talking with you about\
  \ the electric field and electrical potential.</span> <span m='48239'>To get the\
  \ most out of this video you should already have some exposure to the electric</span>\
  \ <span m='52620'>field and electric potential. You should be able to take a mathematical\
  \ expression for</span> <span m='56429'>the field and obtain the potential, and\
  \ vice versa. You should also know how to draw equipotential</span> <span m='62960'>surfaces\
  \ and electric field vectors.</span> <span m='66280'>Throughout this video our goal\
  \ is to help you gain a clearer picture of the electric</span> <span m='70200'>field\
  \ and the electric potential. By the end of the video you should also be able to\
  \ describe</span> <span m='74490'>the process of electrical breakdown by using either\
  \ the field or the potential.</span> <span m='79229'>Let's start with a review of\
  \ electric field and electric potential. First we'll describe</span> <span m='83280'>them\
  \ conceptually. Then we'll show the mathematical relationship between them, and\
  \ show some of</span> <span m='87649'>their typical visual representations.</span>\
  \ <span m='90320'>First, let's see what you remember. Take out a piece of paper\
  \ and write down everything</span> <span m='96090'>you remember about the electric\
  \ field and the electric potential. Try to concentrate</span> <span m='100189'>on\
  \ their similarities and differences. Pause the video to do this.</span> <span m='109490'>Now\
  \ you can compare the list you made to our list.</span> <span m='112869'>The electric\
  \ field is generated by electric charges, and extends an infinite distance</span>\
  \ <span m='116759'>from them.</span> <span m='117750'>If you bring a second electric\
  \ charge into a region of electric field, there will be</span> <span m='121289'>a\
  \ force exerted on it. Like all forces, that force has magnitude and direction.\
  \ The stronger</span> <span m='127920'>the charge is, the more force will be applied\
  \ to it.</span> <span m='130728'>The electric field is a vector quantity. It has\
  \ a vector value at every point in space,</span> <span m='136390'>measured in Newtons\
  \ per Coulomb or Volts per Meter.</span> <span m='139819'>Much like the electric\
  \ field, electric potentials are created by charges and extend an infinite</span>\
  \ <span m='144640'>distance from them.</span> <span m='146290'>If you bring a second\
  \ charge into a region of electrical potential, that second charge</span> <span\
  \ m='150200'>will gain or lose potential energy. The stronger that charge, the more\
  \ its potential energy</span> <span m='155720'>will change.</span> <span m='156989'>Unlike\
  \ the electric field, the electric potential is a scalar quantity, which means that\
  \ everywhere</span> <span m='161680'>you look you can find a number that represents\
  \ the potential, measured in Joules per Coulomb.</span> <span m='168840'>Let's look\
  \ at two ways to envision an electric potential for a positively charged line near</span>\
  \ <span m='172540'>the origin. We're going to look at this in two dimensions to\
  \ make things easier to see.</span> <span m='177599'>We can also draw the level\
  \ curves for the electric potential function. These are called</span> <span m='181750'>\"\
  equipotential lines,\" because the value of the potential is equal at every point\
  \ on a</span> <span m='186060'>given line. For instance, we might draw lines every\
  \ ten volts.</span> <span m='191769'>If we plot the potential on the vertical axis,\
  \ we end up with this mountain-like shape. We</span> <span m='196450'>can imagine\
  \ positive charges rolling down the mountain as they are pushed away from</span>\
  \ <span m='200349'>our line charge.</span> <span m='202299'>We can also sketch the\
  \ electric field around a line charge. If we pick regularly spaced</span> <span\
  \ m='207420'>points at which to draw our electric field vectors, we end up with\
  \ a picture like this</span> <span m='211790'>one. Each vector shows the direction\
  \ and strength of the electric field at that point. The longer</span> <span m='218250'>the\
  \ arrow, the stronger the field is. Here you might imagine the arrows pushing a\
  \ positive</span> <span m='223610'>charge away from our line</span> <span m='226840'>Displaying\
  \ both the equipotential lines and the field vectors at once, we get this picture.</span>\
  \ <span m='232909'>You can see that the equipotential lines are always perpendicular\
  \ to the field.</span> <span m='239099'>Since charges create both fields and potentials,\
  \ both will be present all the time, though</span> <span m='243879'>we might only\
  \ draw one or the other.</span> <span m='246700'>The field and the potential are\
  \ related mathematically through the gradient operator. As a vector</span> <span\
  \ m='252110'>operator, the gradient turns the scalar potential into a vector field.\
  \ To go in the other direction,</span> <span m='259079'>a line integral of the electric\
  \ field turns that vector field into the scalar electric</span> <span m='264170'>potential.</span>\
  \ <span m='266160'>The negative sign that appears in both equations is important\u2014\
  the electric field points in</span> <span m='271110'>the opposite direction from\
  \ any changes in the potential. If the electric potential increases</span> <span\
  \ m='276720'>in a particular direction, the electric field points in the opposite\
  \ direction.</span> <span m='281940'>We're going to use something called \"electrical\
  \ breakdown\" to illustrate our concepts today.</span> <span m='287080'>We'll start\
  \ with an example, give a definition, then go into an explanation of the phenomenon.</span>\
  \ <span m='293500'>Here is a clip from the Boston Museum of Science to demonstrate</span>\
  \ <span m='308610'>the phenomenon.</span> <span m='392990'>Quite a dramatic demonstration!\
  \ Let's look at this in a little more depth.</span> <span m='397050'>Electrical\
  \ breakdown is defined as the process by which an insulating material in a strong</span>\
  \ <span m='402630'>electric field becomes electrically conductive. The material\
  \ actually changes from being an</span> <span m='408530'>insulator to being a conductor.\
  \ In the clip you saw, this happened in the air near the</span> <span m='413780'>Van\
  \ de Graaff generator, and a large electric spark resulted.</span> <span m='418600'>You\
  \ may sometimes hear this referred to as breakdown potential, or breakdown voltage,</span>\
  \ <span m='422520'>which is the same thing.</span> <span m='425290'>The exact value\
  \ of the electric field needed depends on many factors, including distance,</span>\
  \ <span m='430790'>humidity, temperature, and the material itself.</span> <span\
  \ m='434030'>Here is a simplified explanation of how electrical breakdown works\
  \ in air. Consider this house</span> <span m='440250'>in a thunderstorm.</span>\
  \ <span m='442860'>If we zoom in on the air above the house, we can see the molecules\
  \ of gas in the air.</span> <span m='449060'>Thunderstorms involve strong electric\
  \ fields and high electric potential differences. We</span> <span m='454810'>can\
  \ represent those on our diagram.</span> <span m='458560'>Imagine that one electron\
  \ is pulled from its atom by the strong electric field. Because</span> <span m='463500'>the\
  \ electron is negatively charged, it will accelerate against the electric field,\
  \ and</span> <span m='468190'>will eventually collide with another atom. That collision\
  \ might knock another electron</span> <span m='472800'>loose. Now there will be\
  \ two electrons accelerating.</span> <span m='477180'>A single electron can thus\
  \ create a chain reaction, where many atoms lose their electrons.</span> <span m='483310'>This\
  \ creates a region of ionized air. Air is normally a good insulator, but the presence</span>\
  \ <span m='488460'>of ions allows it to conduct electricity.</span> <span m='491120'>...resulting\
  \ in a lightning bolt!</span> <span m='494070'>Let's use the electric field and\
  \ electric potential to investigate this situation further.</span> <span m='499120'>Here\
  \ are the Van de Graaff generators from the video, charged up, with a metal ball\
  \ as</span> <span m='502980'>a target.</span> <span m='505220'>Let's take a simplified\
  \ version of the situation shown. Draw the equipotential surfaces around</span>\
  \ <span m='509690'>these two objects, and then draw in the electric field arrows\
  \ as well. You can ignore the presence</span> <span m='515510'>of the support pillars.</span>\
  \ <span m='517610'>Here are two hints. First, the small metal ball is grounded,\
  \ or \"earthed,\" with an electrical</span> <span m='522530'>potential of zero.\
  \ Second, the electrical charge on the generator will spread itself</span> <span\
  \ m='527690'>equally over the surface of the conducting spheres.</span> <span m='531740'>Pause\
  \ the video here to draw the equipotential lines and the field vectors.</span> <span\
  \ m='539560'>Here's another picture of the generator with the target ball nearby.</span>\
  \ <span m='543620'>This picture is too complex. Let's create a simpler version of\
  \ the picture. That's</span> <span m='549120'>Now we can draw in the lines. Our\
  \ equipotential lines will \"hug\" the surface of the conductors</span> <span m='554380'>when\
  \ they are nearby. Because the charge is spread evenly across the surface of the\
  \ conductor,</span> <span m='559930'>the whole surface will be at the same electric\
  \ potential. The equipotential lines will tend</span> <span m='563990'>to be smoother\
  \ when farther away from the conductors.</span> <span m='567530'>Because the electric\
  \ potential of the Van de Graaff generator gets up to about one million</span> <span\
  \ m='571620'>volts (or 1000 kilovolts), and we have drawn eight lines in the picture,\
  \ each line must</span> <span m='577110'>represent a difference of about 125 kilovolts.</span>\
  \ <span m='581110'>In this view we have colored in the regions where the equipotential\
  \ lines are more closely</span> <span m='585670'>packed, or less closely packed.</span>\
  \ <span m='588640'>In the blue area, with the close-packed lines, the gradient of\
  \ the potential is larger. Because</span> <span m='595090'>the electric field is\
  \ proportional to the gradient of the potential, the places where</span> <span m='598840'>our\
  \ lines are more closely packed will have a stronger electric field.</span> <span\
  \ m='603390'>In the red areas, where equipotential lines are far apart, the gradient\
  \ of the potential</span> <span m='608260'>is smaller. Therefore, the electric field\
  \ will be weaker.</span> <span m='612630'>We can use this as a guide when drawing\
  \ our field vectors.</span> <span m='615870'>Let's draw in those electric field\
  \ vectors now. We have assumed here that the generator</span> <span m='619740'>becomes\
  \ positively charged, but if it were negatively charged, we could simply reverse</span>\
  \ <span m='623900'>the direction of our arrows.</span> <span m='626320'>Look carefully:\
  \ our field arrows are perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces at all points.</span>\
  \ <span m='632050'>Check your own diagram - is this true on yours as well?</span>\
  \ <span m='635970'>Our field arrows are longer where the equipotential lines are\
  \ more closely packed\u2014is this true</span> <span m='640770'>on your diagram?</span>\
  \ <span m='642710'>If you need to revise your diagram or draw a new one, do so now.\
  \ If you have questions</span> <span m='648140'>for your teacher, here is a chance\
  \ to ask them.</span> <span m='650680'>Pause the video here.</span> <span m='657110'>Some\
  \ of you may be confused by the terminology that is used for this phenomenon. Many\
  \ people</span> <span m='661390'>refer to the \"breakdown potential\" required to\
  \ create a spark. However, but you may have</span> <span m='666940'>noticed that\
  \ the sparks in the video were produced where the electric field was the</span>\
  \ <span m='671220'>strongest, not where the electric potential was the highest.\
  \ Turn to a friend and discuss</span> <span m='676060'>why this is the case. Pause\
  \ the video here to discuss.</span> <span m='683320'>If we return to the equations\
  \ that relate the field and the potential, we can improve</span> <span m='686750'>our\
  \ understanding. You can see that we have a gradient term\u2014a derivative with\
  \ respect</span> <span m='692610'>to distance.</span> <span m='693330'>If our potential\
  \ changes slowly over distance, the field is weak, and no spark is generated.</span>\
  \ <span m='699120'>On the other hand, if the potential changes quickly over distance,\
  \ the field is strong.</span> <span m='704880'>A stronger field is more likely to\
  \ remove an electron from an atom.</span> <span m='708370'>In fact, when numerical\
  \ values are given for the breakdown potential, they are most often</span> <span\
  \ m='712790'>given in \"volts per meter,\" which is a measurement of the electric\
  \ field. The term \"breakdown</span> <span m='718420'>potential\" is a little misleading,\
  \ but it is still the standard terminology.</span> <span m='722130'>To review, the\
  \ gradient connects the electric field to the electric potential. A steeper</span>\
  \ <span m='728540'>change in the potential results in a stronger electric field.\
  \ We also saw that electrical</span> <span m='733940'>breakdowns happen in areas\
  \ of strong electric field, or of steep change in electrical potential.</span> <span\
  \ m='741310'>We hope you enjoyed this clip from the Theatre of Electricity at the\
  \ Boston Museum of Science.</span> <span m='746250'>Good luck in your future studies\
  \ of electricity.</span> </p>"
