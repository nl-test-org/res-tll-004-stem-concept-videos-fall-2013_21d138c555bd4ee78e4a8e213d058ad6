title: Kinetic Theory
transcript: "<p><span m='3350'> The development of the incandescent light bulb took\
  \ many years and relied on the talents</span> <span m='7279'>of many inventors from\
  \ around the world. One of the key changes was the use of an inert</span> <span\
  \ m='12039'>gas, rather than a vacuum, in the bulb itself. In this video, we'll\
  \ use the kinetic theory</span> <span m='17350'>of gases to explain why the addition\
  \ of an inert gas had such a significant impact on</span> <span m='22590'>the usability\
  \ and longevity of the humble incandescent bulb.</span> <span m='27110'>This video\
  \ is part of the Governing Rules video series. A small number of rules describe</span>\
  \ <span m='31440'>the physical and chemical interactions that are possible in our\
  \ universe.</span> <span m='35659'>Hi. My name is Jeff Grossman and I am a professor\
  \ in the Department of Materials Science and</span> <span m='41429'>Engineering\
  \ at MIT. Today, I'm going to talk to you about the</span> <span m='46149'>development\
  \ of the incandescent light bulb. In order to understand the topic of this video,</span>\
  \ <span m='52539'>you should be familiar with the kinetic theory of gases.</span>\
  \ <span m='56829'>After watching this video, you should be able to discuss the physical\
  \ significance of a</span> <span m='61519'>gas molecule's mean free path. You should\
  \ also be able to discuss the physical parameters</span> <span m='67390'>that affect\
  \ the mean free path.</span> <span m='71689'>Imagine that you are a consultant for\
  \ a light bulb manufacturer. They have a problem with</span> <span m='77240'>their\
  \ incandescent light bulbs. After the light bulbs have been operating for a period</span>\
  \ <span m='82140'>of time, the inner walls of the bulb begin to blacken. This reduces\
  \ the light output.</span> <span m='88920'>Not a desirable outcome for a light bulb.\
  \ You have been hired to figure out why this</span> <span m='93189'>is happening\
  \ and to determine a way to fix the problem.</span> <span m='97380'>So, what questions\
  \ do you have? What do you think is going on? What chemical principles</span> <span\
  \ m='103479'>might be important here? Take a moment to pause the video and jot down\
  \ some things that</span> <span m='109960'>you think might be relevant to the problem.\
  \ It's okay to brainstorm with a partner.</span> <span m='122090'>It may be helpful\
  \ to understand a few things about the construction of the light bulb.</span> <span\
  \ m='127469'>Looking inside, we see that there is a coil of metal, called the filament.\
  \ This filament</span> <span m='134530'>is typically made of tungsten. What you\
  \ can't see is that the inside of this light bulb</span> <span m='140510'>is a vacuum.\
  \ What would happen if there was air in the light bulb? Because the filament</span>\
  \ <span m='147770'>reaches such high temperatures, the filament will oxidize if\
  \ oxygen is present.</span> <span m='153610'>Some of you may have been wondering\
  \ about the temperature of the tungsten filament.</span> <span m='158360'>When the\
  \ light bulb is on, the tungsten filament gets very hot, around 3000 \xB0C.</span>\
  \ <span m='165630'>While this temperature is below the melting and boiling points\
  \ for tungsten, the occasional</span> <span m='170450'>tungsten atom sublimes and\
  \ condenses on the wall of the light bulb. Not only does this</span> <span m='177610'>reduce\
  \ the light output of the bulb, but it also causes deterioration of the filament.</span>\
  \ <span m='184480'>Knowing what you know about gases, how can you explain what is\
  \ happening and what solution</span> <span m='191230'>might you propose? It might\
  \ help to review some of the assumptions</span> <span m='197200'>of the kinetic\
  \ theory of gases.</span> <span m='199790'>One assumption is that the molecules\
  \ in a gas are separated by distances that are much</span> <span m='205260'>larger\
  \ than the size of the molecules themselves.</span> <span m='208870'>Another is\
  \ that the molecules are constantly moving in random directions.</span> <span m='214000'>The\
  \ molecules obey Newton's laws of motion and thus continue in straight-line motion</span>\
  \ <span m='219920'>until they collide with other molecules or the walls of the container.</span>\
  \ <span m='226050'>Gas molecules that are not in physical contact do not exert forces\
  \ on one another, so between</span> <span m='233190'>collisions, they move with\
  \ constant velocity. Collisions between molecules or between a</span> <span m='238440'>molecule\
  \ and the wall of the container are assumed to be perfectly elastic. In other</span>\
  \ <span m='244660'>words, energy is conserved.</span> <span m='248900'>What factors\
  \ do you think affect a molecule's collision frequency? Pause the video and take</span>\
  \ <span m='254250'>a moment to think about it.</span> <span m='260060'>You may have\
  \ realized that the diameter of a molecule, as well as the number of molecules</span>\
  \ <span m='265330'>in the region will affect collision frequency.</span> <span m='268400'>So\
  \ when a tungsten atom evaporated off of the hot filament under vacuum, what happened?</span>\
  \ <span m='275680'>Pause the video and take a moment to think about it.</span> <span\
  \ m='282510'>The atom proceeded in a straight line, and in the absence of other\
  \ molecules to collide</span> <span m='287470'>with, condensed on the cool wall\
  \ of the light bulb. Under vacuum, the mean free path of</span> <span m='294040'>tungsten\
  \ atoms in the vapor state is quite large.</span> <span m='298260'>What is the mean\
  \ free path?</span> <span m='300370'>The mean free path is the average distance\
  \ traveled by a molecule between collisions.</span> <span m='305850'>The mean free\
  \ path for a molecule can be approximated by the distance traveled by the molecule\
  \ in</span> <span m='311180'>a given time t divided by the number of collisions\
  \ the molecule experienced.</span> <span m='317280'>Although the molecule may exhibit\
  \ a random walk and change direction with each collision</span> <span m='321760'>it\
  \ experiences, we are simply interested in the scalar quantity of total distance\
  \ traveled.</span> <span m='328220'>The total distance traveled can be found by\
  \ multiplying the velocity of the molecule by</span> <span m='332810'>the time.</span>\
  \ <span m='334240'>How do we find the number of collisions? Let's break this down.</span>\
  \ <span m='339460'>If we assume that the molecule is spherical with diameter d,\
  \ as it moves, it will sweep</span> <span m='345000'>out a cylindrical volume equal\
  \ to pi*r-squared*vt. As a first approximation, let's assume that</span> <span m='353090'>our\
  \ molecule is moving through other gas molecules of the same diameter. Any molecule\
  \ whose center</span> <span m='359210'>lies within a distance r of this cylinder\
  \ will collide with our molecule of interest.</span> <span m='365550'>So to find\
  \ the number of collisions, we need to look at the volume pi*d-squared*vt and</span>\
  \ <span m='371800'>multiply this by the density of gas molecules n sub v.</span>\
  \ <span m='376260'>We're not quite done. When looking at the number of collisions,\
  \ we need to keep in mind</span> <span m='381560'>that all of the gas molecules\
  \ are moving, so we should use a relative velocity. The</span> <span m='388169'>relative\
  \ velocity is equal to square root of 2 multiplied by the average velocity.</span>\
  \ <span m='394080'>It would be good for you to think about how we got this.</span>\
  \ <span m='423300'>So now we have this expression for the mean free path.</span>\
  \ <span m='427100'>What would happen to the mean free path of a tungsten atom if\
  \ we introduced other gas</span> <span m='432060'>molecules into the bulb? Would\
  \ the mean free path increase, decrease, or stay the same?</span> <span m='441480'>Pause\
  \ the video and take a moment to think about it.</span> <span m='449520'>You might\
  \ have realized that by introducing other gas molecules into the light bulb, we</span>\
  \ <span m='454400'>can increase the number of collisions a tungsten atom will experience\
  \ and decrease its mean</span> <span m='459840'>free path. Would this be desirable\
  \ or undesirable? Why?</span> <span m='467070'>Decreasing a tungsten atom's mean\
  \ free path is desirable. While some vaporized tungsten</span> <span m='472940'>atoms\
  \ will still condense on the walls of the light bulb, some collisions will result</span>\
  \ <span m='477610'>in tungsten atoms re-condensing on the filament.</span> <span\
  \ m='481520'>You may have noticed blackening near the top of incandescent bulbs\
  \ after they have been</span> <span m='486479'>used for a while. Heat transfer from\
  \ the filament to the fill gas creates convection currents</span> <span m='493340'>that\
  \ carry many of the vaporized tungsten atoms to the top of the bulb where they condense.</span>\
  \ <span m='500229'>This localized darkening allows the light output from other regions\
  \ of the bulb to remain</span> <span m='505330'>relatively constant.</span> <span\
  \ m='507639'>You can see how kinetic theory has helped us think about this problem.\
  \ Of course, there</span> <span m='512990'>are some other things we need to think\
  \ about. For example, what gas should we use? What</span> <span m='518169'>properties\
  \ do you think the gas should have? Pause the video here and take a moment to</span>\
  \ <span m='523578'>think about it.</span> <span m='527309'>Well, if we are going\
  \ to fill our light bulb with gas, we probably want to use something</span> <span\
  \ m='534519'>that is inert to avoid undesirable reactions. For common household\
  \ use, we would also want</span> <span m='542420'>our fill gas to be non-toxic in\
  \ case the glass breaks. And of course, low cost is always</span> <span m='548699'>desirable.</span>\
  \ <span m='550730'>Irving Langmuir actually solved this problem when he was working\
  \ at General Electric in</span> <span m='555649'>the early 1900s. Langmuir chose\
  \ argon as the fill gas because it is inert and non-toxic,</span> <span m='563740'>but\
  \ if you look at the periodic table you might ask why he didn't chose a more massive</span>\
  \ <span m='568449'>inert gas. Argon is much lower in cost compared to other inert\
  \ gases.</span> <span m='575869'>Krypton and xenon are used in more expensive light\
  \ bulbs, but not in household light bulbs.</span> <span m='581990'>Argon continues\
  \ to be used in standard incandescent light bulbs, although the use of incandescent</span>\
  \ <span m='587410'>light bulbs in general is being phased out.</span> <span m='591230'>To\
  \ Review, we saw how kinetic theory can be used to help us analyze a real-world\
  \ problem\u2014that</span> <span m='598329'>of light bulb blackening. We derived\
  \ an equation to allow us to estimate a gas molecule's mean</span> <span m='605089'>free\
  \ path. The mean free path provides an estimate of the average distance traveled</span>\
  \ <span m='611949'>by a molecule between collisions. We saw that the mean free path\
  \ is inversely proportional</span> <span m='618850'>to the density of gas molecules.\
  \ Realizing that the mean free path of tungsten atoms</span> <span m='624439'>in\
  \ a light bulb was too long helped us think about what parameters we might manipulate</span>\
  \ <span m='630329'>in order to solve our problem.</span> </p>"
