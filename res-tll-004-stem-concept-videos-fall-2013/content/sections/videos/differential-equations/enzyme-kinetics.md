title: Enzyme Kinetics
transcript: '<p><span m=''3770''>In beer and wine production, enzymes in yeast aid
  the conversion of sugar into ethanol.</span> </p><p><span m=''9620''>Enzymes are
  used in cheese-making to degrade proteins in milk, changing their solubility,</span>
  <span m=''13600''>and causing the proteins to precipitate. Many industrial processes
  ranging from fruit juice</span> <span m=''18789''>production to paper production
  to biofuel production utilize enzymes. In this video</span> <span m=''23770''>you''ll
  see that studying how enzymes catalyze reactions can help us design better therapeutics.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''30330''>This video is part of the Differential Equations video
  series. Laws that govern a system''s</span> <span m=''34489''>properties can be
  modeled using differential equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''37610''>Hi. My name
  is Krystyn Van Vliet and I am a professor in the Materials Science and Engineering</span>
  <span m=''43070''>and Biological Engineering departments at MIT.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''45380''>of reactions and after some practice, you will be able to derive a rate
  law for a general</span> <span m=''46320''>enzyme-catalyzed reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''46620''>In order to understand the topic of this video, you should be familiar
  with determining rate</span> <span m=''52329''>laws from experimental data, predicting
  rate laws from proposed chemical reaction mechanisms,</span> <span m=''58450''>and
  have some basic understanding of the effects of catalysts on the kinetics of a reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''68689''>The study of enzyme catalysis has become important for
  drug development. Many drugs work by inhibiting</span> <span m=''83039''>an enzyme.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''84459''>For example, enzymes thought to be important for the survival
  and replication of the parasite</span> <span m=''89069''>that causes malaria are
  being explored as therapeutic targets. The parasites enter the</span> <span m=''94499''>red
  blood cells of the host and use proteases to catalyze the degradation of the hemoglobin</span>
  <span m=''102240''>inside of the red blood cells. Degrading hemoglobin, a protein,
  yields amino acids, which can then</span> <span m=''109399''>be used by the parasite
  for its own protein synthesis. Protease inhibitors could help</span> <span m=''114709''>slow
  the degradation of hemoglobin, which in turn would slow the growth and reproduction</span>
  <span m=''119749''>of the malaria parasite.</span> </p><p><span m=''122369''>When
  a potential inhibitor is identified, kinetic data is used to evaluate its efficacy.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''128679''>In order to understand how this can be done, let''s start
  by describing the kinetics of</span> <span m=''132770''>a simpler case -- that of
  an enzyme catalyzed reaction without an inhibitor present. Then</span> <span m=''138550''>we''ll
  think about what might happen if we throw an inhibitor into the mix.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''141720''>This video will help you describe enzyme catalysis mathematically by
  first reviewing some common</span> <span m=''143200''>biochemical terms, then by
  describing the general characteristics of enzyme-catalyzed</span> <span m=''143700''>you
  will encounter throughout your undergraduate experience.</span> </p><p><span m=''147790''>a
  reactant is called a substrate. This is really just a matter of different fields
  using</span> <span m=''153040''>different terms, but it''s important for you to
  be aware of this. Next, catalysts found</span> <span m=''158280''>in biological
  organisms are called enzymes. Textbooks frequently abbreviate "substrate"</span>
  <span m=''163829''>using the letter "S" and enzyme using the letter "E."</span>
  <span m=''167860''>How do enzymes work? If we look at a reaction coordinate, recall
  that the transition state</span> <span m=''173700''>represents a chemical species
  intermediate between the reactant, or substrate in this</span> <span m=''179190''>case,
  and the product. The potential energy difference between the transition state and</span>
  <span m=''184620''>the reactants is the activation energy for the forward reaction.
  The potential energy</span> <span m=''190340''>difference between the transition
  state and the products is the activation energy for</span> <span m=''194550''>the
  reverse reaction. Only reactants with the energy to overcome the activation energy</span>
  <span m=''200480''>will form products.</span> </p><p><span m=''202760''>Like synthetic
  catalysts, enzymes accelerate the rates of reactions by stabilizing the</span> <span
  m=''208000''>transition state, lowering its potential energy, and providing a new
  pathway by which the reaction</span> <span m=''213400''>can occur. This new reaction
  pathway has a lower activation energy than the uncatalyzed</span> <span m=''219500''>path
  making it more likely that a greater number of reactant molecules will have the</span>
  <span m=''224250''>energy needed to overcome the activation energy and proceed to
  product.</span> </p><p><span m=''230620''>Enzymes facilitate reactions, but, like
  other catalysts, are not consumed in the reaction.</span> </p><p><span m=''237040''>Enzymes
  are typically proteins, but RNA has also been shown to catalyze reactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''243250''>While there are different theories about how enzymes work
  to catalyze reactions, there</span> <span m=''248350''>are a couple of things that
  are agreed upon. One is that enzymes have a region called an</span> <span m=''252620''>active
  site. Substrates bind to this region. The shape and chemistry of the active site</span>
  <span m=''258959''>determine the selectivity of the enzyme for particular substrates.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''263689''>The second point is that when a substrate binds to an
  enzyme, an enzyme-substrate complex</span> <span m=''269460''>is formed. This enzyme-substrate
  complex is a reaction intermediate, meaning that it is</span> <span m=''276650''>formed
  and consumed in the reactions, but does not appear in the overall chemical equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''283889''>For many enzyme-catalyzed reactions, if we were to measure
  the rate of reaction at various</span> <span m=''289919''>substrate concentrations,
  we would see that the rate of reaction appears to follow first</span> <span m=''297080''>order
  kinetics at low substrate concentrations and then transitions to behavior that resembles</span>
  <span m=''304270''>zero-order kinetics at high substrate concentrations. Please
  pause the video here, turn to the person</span> <span m=''311830''>beside you and
  discuss what it means for a reaction to be first-order or zero-order.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''318289''>Remember, in a first-order reaction, the reaction rate is directly
  proportional to the concentration</span> <span m=''328360''>of substrate. In a zero-order
  reaction, the reaction rate is constant as the reaction</span> <span m=''334229''>progresses
  and is unaffected by substrate concentration. So, if we look at this data,</span>
  <span m=''340449''>we see that, for a given enzyme concentration, the addition of
  substrate above a certain</span> <span m=''345330''>value has no effect on the rate
  of reaction.</span> </p><p><span m=''350139''>So let''s think about what reaction
  mechanism might explain this data.</span> </p><p><span m=''355180''>Some scientists
  hypothesized that after an enzyme and substrate combine to form the enzyme-substrate</span>
  <span m=''360620''>complex, this complex yields the product and degrades to regenerate
  free enzyme. Does the</span> <span m=''368089''>rate law derived from this reaction
  mechanism fit the experimental data?</span> </p><p><span m=''374300''>Let''s derive
  the rate law and see. We can derive this rate law just as we would for</span> <span
  m=''379740''>other chemical systems.</span> </p><p><span m=''381889''>Remember,
  each step of a reaction mechanism is assumed to be an elementary reaction. Please</span>
  <span m=''389300''>pause the video here, turn to the person beside you and discuss
  how you determine the rate</span> <span m=''395389''>law for an elementary reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''400620''>Remember, for an elementary reaction, you CAN predict
  the rate law from the chemical</span> <span m=''408439''>equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''410389''>With this in mind, can you write a differential equation for the rate
  of product formation</span> <span m=''415490''>with time? Please pause the video,
  try to write the equation, and continue playing the</span> <span m=''421849''>video
  to see if you are correct.</span> </p><p><span m=''429979''>From the 2nd step of
  the reaction mechanism, we can write that the rate of formation of</span> <span
  m=''438139''>product is equal to the rate constant k2 multiplied by the concentration
  of our enzyme-substrate</span> <span m=''444979''>complex.</span> </p><p><span m=''447659''>The
  enzyme-substrate complex is a reaction intermediate and not something that is easily</span>
  <span m=''453409''>measured in experiments. How can we verify if this expression
  is correct? It would be</span> <span m=''461080''>nice to restate the rate in terms
  of quantities that are more easily measured such as the</span> <span m=''467729''>substrate
  concentration and the initial enzyme concentration.</span> </p><p><span m=''472830''>To
  get an expression for the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex, let''s
  write</span> <span m=''478499''>a differential equation for the net rate of change
  of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration</span> <span m=''485759''>with time.
  Please pause the video here, try to write the differential equation, and then</span>
  <span m=''494270''>continue playing the video to see if you are correct.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''503889''>If we want to write an expression for d[ES]/dt, we see
  that in the first step of our mechanism,</span> <span m=''510899''>the enzyme-substrate
  complex is produced in the forward direction and consumed in the</span> <span m=''515640''>reverse
  direction. In the second step, the enzyme-substrate complex is converted into</span>
  <span m=''522520''>product.</span> </p><p><span m=''523580''>This equation introduces
  two additional unknowns: the free enzyme concentration and substrate</span> <span
  m=''529940''>concentration. So, we need two additional equations in order to solve
  it.</span> </p><p><span m=''536150''>Can you write an equation for the rate of change
  of substrate concentration with time?</span> </p><p><span m=''541190''>Please pause
  the video here, try to write the differential equation, and then continue</span>
  <span m=''545690''>playing the video to see if you are correct.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''553310''>If we want to write an expression for d[S]/dt, we see that the substrate
  will be consumed</span> <span m=''559150''>in the forward direction and produced
  in the reverse direction of the first step of the</span> <span m=''564000''>reaction
  mechanism.</span> </p><p><span m=''567160''>We still need one more equation. This
  equation is a simple relationship that says we know</span> <span m=''573710''>how
  much enzyme we added to our reaction mixture at time zero, so at any time, we know
  that</span> <span m=''580470''>the amount of free enzyme plus the amount of enzyme
  bound in the enzyme-substrate complex</span> <span m=''586710''>should equal the
  initial amount added. This could also be written in differential form</span> <span
  m=''593020''>as d[E]/dt plus d[ES]/dt is equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''598000''>So,
  we have a system of four ordinary differential equations with four variables that
  all depend</span> <span m=''605580''>on time. Equation 1 and Equation 4 have analytic
  solutions, but Equations 2 and 3 contain a</span> <span m=''616800''>non-linear
  term. When you learn about differential equations in your future courses, you''ll
  see</span> <span m=''622740''>why these equations are difficult to solve and that
  you will need numerical methods to</span> <span m=''627930''>solve them.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''630600''>Here, we have integrated these equations numerically using
  the boundary conditions that at time</span> <span m=''638010''>equals zero, the
  substrate concentration is S0, the product concentration is zero, the</span> <span
  m=''647280''>enzyme concentration is E0 and the concentration of enzyme bound to
  substrate is zero.</span> </p><p><span m=''655020''>We see that after a short start-up
  period, the concentration of enzyme bound to substrate</span> <span m=''661350''>remains
  approximately constant. In this region, where the substrate concentration is much</span>
  <span m=''667810''>greater than E0, as enzyme is released from the enzyme-substrate
  complex, it quickly recombines</span> <span m=''675510''>with available substrate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''678410''>As more substrate is converted to product and the substrate
  concentration approaches</span> <span m=''683190''>E0, the concentration of enzyme
  bound to substrate is no longer constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''690540''>In the
  regime where the substrate concentration IS greater than E0, we can make a steady-state</span>
  <span m=''696840''>approximation and set d[ES]/dt equal to zero. This approximation
  will allow us to obtain</span> <span m=''704930''>an analytic expression for the
  concentration of enzyme bound to substrate.</span> </p><p><span m=''711600''>Setting
  d[ES]/dt equal to zero allows us to solve for the concentration of enzyme-substrate</span>
  <span m=''717360''>complex, which is equal to the rate constant k1 times the concentration
  of free enzyme</span> <span m=''724630''>times the concentration of substrate divided
  by the sum of k-1 and k2.</span> </p><p><span m=''732180''>Let''s lump the rate
  constants into a new term called Km and substitute this into our expression</span>
  <span m=''738950''>for the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''744100''>Now we can use this expression... ... to rewrite d[P]/dt.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''749920''>Let''s try to eliminate the concentration of free enzyme from this
  expression. We can use</span> <span m=''755140''>the enzyme balance that we wrote
  earlier, which said that the concentration of free</span> <span m=''759260''>enzyme
  plus the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex should equal the initial enzyme
  concentration.</span> </p><p><span m=''768130''>Substituting our expression for
  the concentration of ES into the enzyme balance and doing a</span> <span m=''773680''>little
  bit of algebra, we can solve for the concentration of free enzyme.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''779700''>And finally, we can substitute this into our equation for d[P]/dt and
  obtain this expression.</span> </p><p><span m=''788070''>Let''s check this rate
  law against our experimental data. At low substrate concentration, the</span> <span
  m=''794880''>expression reduces to a first-order rate law and at high substrate
  concentration; the expression</span> <span m=''800400''>reduces to a zero order
  rate law.</span> </p><p><span m=''804320''>It turns out that the rate law that we
  just derived is called the Michaelis-Menten equation.</span> </p><p><span m=''808310''>To
  make our equation look more like the version of the Michaelis-Menten equation that
  you</span> <span m=''817040''>will see in textbooks, there are a couple of terms
  that we will use because they are</span> <span m=''822530''>the convention in enzyme
  kinetics. Instead of saying d[P]/dt is the rate of the reaction,</span> <span m=''831960''>we
  will call it the velocity of the reaction and use the notation of ''v.''</span>
  <span m=''837480''>Finally, we''ll lump k2[E]o into a term called vmax. At high
  substrate concentration, the</span> <span m=''846800''>reaction velocity approaches
  vmax.</span> </p><p><span m=''850370''>Remember that lump parameter Km? We can determine
  Km from experimental data. If we look at the</span> <span m=''857370''>substrate
  concentration needed to reach half of vmax, we see that the concentration of</span>
  <span m=''863620''>substrate required equals Km. Km values for many enzyme-substrate
  pairs can be found in</span> <span m=''871330''>the literature allowing for comparison.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''876910''>You may be wondering why we went through all of this.
  Let''s go back to our drug development</span> <span m=''881440''>example.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''883140''>Let''s say that you have designed a drug that you think
  will inhibit one of the proteases</span> <span m=''887640''>used by the malaria
  parasite to degrade hemoglobin. How will you test its effectiveness?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''894420''>First, you might add a fixed amount of protease to solutions of varying
  hemoglobin concentration</span> <span m=''901560''>in order to measure reaction
  rates. Let''s say that this reaction follows Michaelis-Menten</span> <span m=''907240''>kinetics
  well and that you are able to estimate vmax and Km.</span> </p><p><span m=''911640''>Next,
  you repeat the experiment, but this time, you also add a fixed amount of the drug</span>
  <span m=''917470''>candidate to all of your solutions. You get your rate data and
  see that the apparent vmax</span> <span m=''923460''>has decreased. But what does
  this mean? Can you speculate how this inhibitor works?</span> </p><p><span m=''931690''>Is
  the drug interacting with the enzyme and preventing it from binding substrate?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''938040''>Is the drug interacting with the enzyme-substrate complex?
  Is it something else entirely?</span> </p><p><span m=''944850''>The thought process
  that you used today to derive the Michaelis-Menten equation can be</span> <span
  m=''950050''>used to derive rate laws for other reaction mechanisms. Then you can
  see which mechanism</span> <span m=''956750''>is best supported by the data.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''962050''>Today we learned a little bit about the importance of
  enzymes and derived a rate law from a general</span> <span m=''968010''>reaction
  mechanism using differential equations and a steady-state approximation. This rate</span>
  <span m=''974350''>law was compared against experimental rate data for an enzyme
  catalyzing the conversion</span> <span m=''979590''>of a substrate to a product.
  The equation that we derived is called the Michaelis-Menten</span> <span m=''985960''>equation.
  While all enzyme-catalyzed reactions may not exhibit Michaelis-Menten kinetics,</span>
  <span m=''992290''>the same logic that you used to derive the equation can be used
  to derive rate laws for</span> <span m=''997240''>other proposed reaction mechanisms.</span>
