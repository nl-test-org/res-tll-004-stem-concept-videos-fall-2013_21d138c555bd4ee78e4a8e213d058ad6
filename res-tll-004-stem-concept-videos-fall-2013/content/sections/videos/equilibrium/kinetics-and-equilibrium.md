transcript: '<p><span m=''4420''>If you''re driving down the highway and want to see
  how fast you''re going, you look down</span> <span m=''8850''>at your speedometer.
  If you''re in a lab and want to see how fast a chemical reaction is</span> <span
  m=''13450''>going, it''s a little more complicated. In this video we''ll look at
  a few factors that</span> <span m=''18380''>influence the speed of chemical reactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''21730''>This video is part of the Equilibrium video series. It
  is often important to determine</span> <span m=''26039''>whether or not a system
  is at equilibrium, to do this we must understand how a system''s</span> <span m=''30680''>equilibrium
  state is constrained by its boundary and surroundings.</span> </p><p><span m=''34720''>Hi,
  my name is George Zaidan and I''m a graduate of the chemistry department here at
  MIT.</span> </p><p><span m=''39970''>Before watching this video, you should have
  a basic understanding of chemical equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m=''45070''>After
  watching this video, you will be able to:</span> <span m=''48390''>Understand how
  reaction rate is influenced by reactant concentration</span> <span m=''52820''>Explain
  how reaction rates change as a system establishes equilibrium, AND</span> <span
  m=''57309''>Predict relative equilibrium concentrations of reactant and product,
  based on rates of</span> <span m=''62129''>forward and reverse processes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''69880''>Suppose you have this general reaction where A, B, C, and
  D are molecules and lowercase</span> <span m=''76920''>a, b, c, d are their molar
  coefficients. As the reaction progresses, A and B will be</span> <span m=''84259''>consumed,
  and C and D will be formed.</span> </p><p><span m=''87119''>The speed at which any
  of these four processes happen multiplied by the reciprocal of the</span> <span
  m=''92158''>appropriate molar coefficient is called the rate of this reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''97158''>If you want your car to go faster, you step on the gas,
  but speeding up a chemical reaction</span> <span m=''102149''>is not that simple.
  There are lots of different factors that affect reaction rate. Three common</span>
  <span m=''107499''>ones are: the concentration of reactants, the temperature of
  the reaction mixture and</span> <span m=''112609''>the presence of a catalyst. In
  this video we''ll focus on the effect of concentration</span> <span m=''117679''>on
  homogenous reactions.</span> </p><p><span m=''120460''>Most chemical reactions are
  the result of two or more molecules colliding with each</span> <span m=''124670''>other...
  but not every collision leads to a reaction. The molecules must collide in</span>
  <span m=''130330''>the proper physical orientation, and they must do so with enough
  energy to break their</span> <span m=''135510''>bonds.</span> </p><p><span m=''137040''>Imagine
  a beaker with 100 mL of water, in which you dissolve 106 molecules of reactant</span>
  <span m=''142200''>A and 106 molecules of reactant B. How likely is the reaction
  to form C and D? Do a back</span> <span m=''149430''>of the envelope calculation
  to support your answer. Pause the video.</span> </p><p><span m=''159439''>So let''s
  see. 100 mL of water is 100 grams of water, which is 100 over 18.02, about 5.5</span>
  <span m=''166610''>moles of water. That means there are about 3.3x1024 molecules
  of water in the beaker,</span> <span m=''173629''>and only 106 molecules of each
  reactant...So in any given volume of this solution, 3.3x1024</span> <span m=''181450''>over
  (3.3x1024 + 106 + 106), or 99.99999999999999994 %, of molecules are nonreactive
  water!</span> </p><p><span m=''202720''>Clearly, successful collisions between the
  reactants would be very rare in this situation.</span> </p><p><span m=''208370''>Intuitively,
  you would expect that the more concentrated the reactants, the faster the</span>
  <span m=''212980''>reaction, and this is generally true.</span> </p><p><span m=''215680''>Let''s
  draw a reaction coordinate diagram to better understand our hypothetical reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''225390''>Let''s assume that the reaction is exothermic, in other
  words, that energy is given off as</span> <span m=''235709''>the reaction progresses,
  so we draw the curve like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''238629''>The x-axis is the
  progress of the reaction, and the y-axis is potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''239189''>Here are the reactants, and here are the products.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''239560''>This hump is the activation energy, the point of highest potential
  energy of the reaction.</span> </p><p><span m=''245870''>Two molecules must collide
  with at least this amount of energy in order to successfully</span> <span m=''251319''>react.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''252120''>Do you notice anything about this diagram? There''s no
  indication of directionality; in</span> <span m=''257798''>other words, there''s
  no reason that the reaction couldn''t proceed backwards just as well as</span> <span
  m=''262650''>forwards.</span> </p><p><span m=''264260''>You''re probably used to
  thinking of chemical reactions as processes that happen in only</span> <span m=''268290''>one
  direction (forward), but most reactions are actually reversible. There are a few
  exceptions,</span> <span m=''275060''>for example combustion. *You can''t un-burn
  a match. But most reactions that chemists</span> <span m=''282620''>carry out in
  the lab or that happen in our bodies are reversible.</span> </p><p><span m=''287350''>Draw
  your own reaction coordinate diagram and label the forward and reverse reaction</span>
  <span m=''291250''>paths. Suggest what the relationship might be between the activation
  energy and the relative</span> <span m=''296650''>rates of the forward and reverse
  reactions. Pause the video.</span> </p><p><span m=''307360''>This is the activation
  energy for the forward reaction. The higher this activation energy,</span> <span
  m=''311720''>the slower the forward reaction, because the number of reactant molecules
  with sufficient</span> <span m=''316160''>energy to react when they collide will
  decrease.</span> </p><p><span m=''320360''>But now let''s look at this picture in
  reverse. The reverse activation energy is not the same</span> <span m=''325600''>as
  the forward activation energy! In this case, it''s higher. So that means that the</span>
  <span m=''331100''>reverse reaction will be slower than the forward reaction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''335140''>If we were to somehow increase the activation energy,
  both the forward and the reverse rates</span> <span m=''340700''>would slow down,
  but the relationship between them -- namely that the forward rate is faster</span>
  <span m=''346500''>than the reverse rate -- would be preserved.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''349650''>Here are four other diagrams, each for a different hypothetical reaction.
  Predict the relative</span> <span m=''354850''>rates of the forward and reverse
  reactions in each of these cases. Pause the video.</span> </p><p><span m=''366520''>In</span>
  <span m=''389720''>real life chemical processes, the rates of the forward and reverse
  reactions are often</span> <span m=''393930''>very different. Many of the reactions
  that you may have previously thought of as "irreversible"actually</span> <span m=''399520''>just
  have wildly different forward and reverse rates. For example, you''ve probably seen
  the</span> <span m=''404750''>dissociation of a strong acid in water written like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m=''408720''>But really, it''s this. In this case, the
  forward reaction is many orders of magnitude faster</span> <span m=''415180''>than
  the reverse reaction, so we write it as just the forward reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''424940''>So far we''ve seen that concentration and activation energy can each
  independently affect the rate</span> <span m=''430300''>of a chemical reaction.
  The higher the concentration of a reactant, the faster the reaction; and</span>
  <span m=''435150''>the lower the activation energy, the faster the reaction. But
  there''s a twist... Thinking</span> <span m=''440490''>about the hypothetical reaction
  A and B yields C and D. Suggest what that twist might be.</span> </p><p><span m=''449810''>Pause
  the video.</span> </p><p><span m=''457620''>There''s no reason that the activation
  energy of this reaction would change as the reaction</span> <span m=''462050''>progresses.
  But that''s not true for the concentrations: as A and B are converted to C and D,
  the concentration</span> <span m=''469300''>of all four species change! And as the
  concentrations change, the reaction rate also changes.</span> </p><p><span m=''476810''>To
  see if we can understand how the reaction rate changes as the reaction progresses,
  let''s</span> <span m=''481710''>go back to the reaction coordinate diagram. Let''s
  start by considering both the forward</span> <span m=''486930''>and reverse reactions
  as if they''re completely separate.</span> </p><p><span m=''491210''>Here are A
  and B reacting to form C and D. Let''s assume this forward reaction is relatively</span>
  <span m=''498270''>fast. As more and more A and B get converted to products, their
  concentrations decrease,</span> <span m=''504490''>and the initially fast reaction
  rate slows over time. Here are C and D reacting to form</span> <span m=''510950''>A
  and B. This reaction would be slower than this one, but as C and D react, their
  concentrations</span> <span m=''518649''>decrease with time and the reaction becomes
  even slower.</span> </p><p><span m=''523099''>Except that in reality, these aren''t
  two separate reactions. The products of one reaction are</span> <span m=''530970''>the
  reactants for the other. Let''s now consider the forward and reverse</span> <span
  m=''535649''>reactions at the same time. At the very very beginning, only A and
  B are present -- no</span> <span m=''541600''>C or D. So the initial rate of the
  forward reaction will be relatively high, since the</span> <span m=''546680''>concentrations
  of A and B are high. The reverse reaction can''t happen at all yet, because</span>
  <span m=''552740''>there is no C and D present, so its initial rate is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''557279''>As the reaction proceeds, two things happen: the concentrations
  of A and B decrease, and</span> <span m=''563629''>the concentrations of C and D
  increase. So the forward reaction rate slows, and the reverse</span> <span m=''569920''>reaction
  rate speeds up. Eventually, we reach a point where the rates</span> <span m=''574319''>of
  the forward and reverse reactions are the same: this is the definition of a dynamic</span>
  <span m=''579839''>chemical equilibrium. When this happens, the concentrations of
  A, B, C, and D stop changing</span> <span m=''586670''>with time. Be careful not
  to confuse equilibrium with "no reaction."A and B are still reacting</span> <span
  m=''594500''>to form C and D; and C and D are still reacting to form A and B. But
  the rate of formation</span> <span m=''600290''>of products equals the rate of disappearance
  of reactants and vice versa. That means that</span> <span m=''605100''>the concentrations
  of A, B, C, and D don''t change with time.</span> </p><p><span m=''610310''>Let''s
  go back to our reaction coordinate diagrams for our four hypothetical reactions.
  We''ve</span> <span m=''615180''>already worked out the relative rates of the forward
  and reverse reactions in each case.</span> </p><p><span m=''620459''>Using these
  relative rates, see if you can predict the relative concentrations of the</span>
  <span m=''624730''>reactants and products at equilibrium. Pause the video.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''636279''>-Endo, high Ea: lots of reactant, not much product</span>
  <span m=''643220''>-Exo, high Ea: lots of product, not much reactant</span> <span
  m=''647379''>-(In both of these cases, the forward rate is the same as the reverse
  rate...)Same energy,</span> <span m=''654149''>high Ea: ratio of product/reactant
  will depend on specific reaction Same energy, low Ea:</span> <span m=''668569''>ratio
  of product/reactant will depend on specific reaction</span> <span m=''671680''>Now
  what''s the difference between the last two scenarios? In each case, the forward
  reaction</span> <span m=''676819''>rate will be the same as the reverse reaction
  rate. But the rates for this scenario will</span> <span m=''681050''>be much faster
  than for this one... so equilibrium will be reached much more quickly here than</span>
  <span m=''687480''>here! The most important thing to understand about</span> <span
  m=''691180''>reaction rates and equilibrium is that just because the forward and
  reverse rates are</span> <span m=''695769''>the same DOES NOT mean that the concentrations
  of the reactants and products are the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''702629''>Some
  equilibria, like the dissociation of a strong acid in water, strongly favor the</span>
  <span m=''707129''>products. Others strongly favor the reactants. Many of the reactions
  that keep us alive are</span> <span m=''713740''>equilibria, and our body goes to
  a great deal of effort to make sure that the position of</span> <span m=''717449''>equilibrium
  heavily favors one side or the other.</span> </p><p><span m=''727089''>We hope this
  video has helped you understand the relationship between reaction rates and</span>
  <span m=''730749''>equilibrium. We saw that, in general, the rate of a reaction
  decreases as reactant concentration</span> <span m=''737009''>decreases.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''738040''>And while we may think of reactions as irreversible, most
  are actually reversible, it''s just that</span> <span m=''743079''>we "see"the faster
  of the two.</span> </p><p><span m=''745620''>As the forward reaction rate decreases,
  the reverse reaction rate increases until equilibrium</span> <span m=''750899''>is
  established. At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of
  the</span> <span m=''755949''>reverse reaction, but this does not imply anything
  about the equilibrium concentrations</span> <span m=''761059''>of the products and
  reactants.</span> </p>'
