transcript: "<p><span m='2800'> What's the fuel consumption of a car? Say, on the\
  \ highway moving at highway speeds? We</span> <span m='8760'>can look it up, but\
  \ can we understand those numbers? Can we predict them from our knowledge</span>\
  \ <span m='13100'>of science and engineering? That's what we're gonna do in this\
  \ video.</span> <span m='18619'>This video is part of the problem solving video\
  \ series.</span> <span m='21859'>Problem-solving skills, in combination with an\
  \ understanding of the natural and human-made</span> <span m='27460'>world, are\
  \ critical to the design and optimization of systems and processes.</span> <span\
  \ m='32659'>Hi, my name is Sanjoy Mahajan, and I'm a professor of Applied Science\
  \ and Engineering at Olin</span> <span m='38399'>College. And I excel at streetfighting\
  \ mathematics. Before watching this video, you should be</span> <span m='43899'>familiar\
  \ with free body diagrams and dimensional analysis.</span> <span m='49359'>After\
  \ watching this video, you will be able to: Model drag to predict terminal velocities;</span>\
  \ <span m='54370'>and Determine the fuel efficiency of a car.</span> <span m='62329'>Fuel\
  \ is consumed in fighting drag, on the highway at least. What's the force of drag</span>\
  \ <span m='67330'>on a car? That's fluid mechanics. We could try the hard way\u2014\
  solving the Navier-Stokes,</span> <span m='72770'>the equations of fluid mechanics.</span>\
  \ <span m='75430'>Now after 10 years of learning mathematics, you'll discover this\
  \ is a really hard problem.</span> <span m='81690'>You can only solve it analytically\
  \ in certain special cases like a sphere moving at really</span> <span m='86240'>slow\
  \ speeds and a car is not one of those special cases; certainly not a car moving</span>\
  \ <span m='91590'>at any reasonable speed. So we need another way.</span> <span\
  \ m='96430'>By applying approximations artfully, we're gonna find the drag force\
  \ and the fuel consumption</span> <span m='100990'>of a car with a simple experiment\
  \ and some scientific and engineering reasoning.</span> <span m='107910'>First,\
  \ we need to model drag. To do this, we're gonna figure out how the drag force</span>\
  \ <span m='114800'>depends on the quantities that control it. Drag force F depends\
  \ on the density of the</span> <span m='119650'>air, to some power which we don't\
  \ know yet, times the speed of the car moving through</span> <span m='124240'>the\
  \ air, to some power we don't know yet. It depends on how big the car is, which\
  \ we'll</span> <span m='129250'>represent by the area; traditionally, the cross-\
  \ sectional area, to some power. And</span> <span m='134220'>it also can depend\
  \ on the viscosity here, the kinematic viscosity of the air to some</span> <span\
  \ m='139190'>power. And what those powers are, we don't yet know. To figure them\
  \ out, let's do an</span> <span m='145560'>experiment.</span> <span m='146880'>For\
  \ the experiment, we make two cones. First, by making a large circle and cutting\
  \ out a</span> <span m='152000'>quarter of it. The large circle has a radius of\
  \ seven centimeters. And the small three-quarter</span> <span m='157480'>circle\
  \ has half the radius. Cut them out and then tape this edge to that edge and this</span>\
  \ <span m='162800'>edge to that edge in order to make the 2 cones.</span> <span\
  \ m='166950'>Next we're gonna race them, the big cone vs. the small cone. But first,\
  \ make a prediction.</span> <span m='173850'>The question is: what is the ratio\
  \ of fall speeds of the big cone and the small cone</span> <span m='178680'>approximately?\
  \ Is the big cone roughly twice as fast, is the small cone twice as fast,</span>\
  \ <span m='183959'>or do they fall at roughly the same speed? Pause the video and\
  \ make your best guess.</span> <span m='190200'>You may want to try the experiment\
  \ yourself.</span> <span m='199990'>The experimental result is that they both fall\
  \ at roughly the same speed. Now what does</span> <span m='205300'>that mean for\
  \ the exponents in the drag force? To decide, use a free body diagram. Here is</span>\
  \ <span m='211870'>a free body diagram of a cone as it falls. What are the forces\
  \ on the cone? Pause and</span> <span m='217430'>fill in the diagram.</span> <span\
  \ m='225209'>There is drag and gravity. Because the cones are falling at their terminal\
  \ speed, in other</span> <span m='230020'>words at the constant velocity that they\
  \ reach pretty quickly, the drag must equal the force</span> <span m='234709'>due\
  \ to gravity. So the drag force can easily be measured just</span> <span m='239160'>by\
  \ sticking the cones on a scale. We don't actually have to stick the cones on a\
  \ scale</span> <span m='243910'>because we know what their relative weights are\
  \ and that's what we're gonna use to figure</span> <span m='247709'>out one of the\
  \ exponents.</span> <span m='249819'>Knowing that the drag equals the force due\
  \ to gravity, let's compare the drag forces,</span> <span m='255090'>which are the\
  \ factors on the right side, of the small and large cones. The large cone</span>\
  \ <span m='260459'>was made out of a paper circle with twice the radius so it has\
  \ four times the area,</span> <span m='265319'>four times the mass, and four times\
  \ the force due to gravity. Therefore, four times the</span> <span m='270960'>drag\
  \ force.</span> <span m='272960'>Now let's look at the causes one by one. This density\
  \ here is the density of the air and</span> <span m='278379'>both cones feel the\
  \ same air so there's no difference here, so that's times one no matter</span> <span\
  \ m='283340'>the exponent. Now, what about the speed? The speeds were the same;\
  \ that was the result</span> <span m='289110'>of our experiment, so no matter what\
  \ the exponent here, the speed contributes to the effect</span> <span m='293979'>by\
  \ a factor of one; in other words, nothing. Now the area. This is traditionally\
  \ the cross-sectional</span> <span m='300960'>area. The big cone has four times\
  \ the cross-sectional area of the small cone so this area factor</span> <span m='307330'>is\
  \ times four and raised to the unknown exponent. And here, the kinematic viscosity,\
  \ that's</span> <span m='314330'>the kinematic viscosity of air and both cones feel\
  \ the same kinematic viscosity. Therefore,</span> <span m='320919'>that contributes\
  \ a factor of one just like the density does.</span> <span m='325520'>So now we\
  \ know what the question mark here has to be. The question mark here must be</span>\
  \ <span m='330270'>one so that this four to the question mark is equal to this four.\
  \ And so does this one.</span> <span m='339960'>Now that we have found one exponent,\
  \ we can find the remaining three using dimensional</span> <span m='344169'>analysis.</span>\
  \ <span m='346308'>We make sure that the exponents chosen on the right side produce\
  \ dimensions of force,</span> <span m='351539'>which are the dimensions on the left\
  \ side. A force has dimensions of mass, length per</span> <span m='356729'>time\
  \ squared, that's mass times acceleration.</span> <span m='361740'>Density has dimensions\
  \ of mass per length cubed, raised to this unknown exponent. Velocity</span> <span\
  \ m='367559'>has dimensions of length per time, raised to this unknown exponent.\
  \ Area has dimensions</span> <span m='373689'>of length squared, raised to the power\
  \ 1, we've already figured that out. And kinematic</span> <span m='379409'>viscosity;\
  \ now, that's the regular viscosity divided by the density. It has dimensions</span>\
  \ <span m='384529'>of length squared per time raised to this unknown exponent</span>\
  \ <span m='391439'>Now let's solve for these unknown exponents one at a time. Looking\
  \ first at the mass,</span> <span m='396689'>there is mass here and mass here on\
  \ the left side, but there is no other mass. So the only</span> <span m='402039'>way\
  \ to get the mass to work out is to make this exponent one.</span> <span m='406529'>Now,\
  \ what do we have left? We have to make sure the lengths and times work out and\
  \ we</span> <span m='412719'>have two unknowns, this exponent and this exponent.</span>\
  \ <span m='417719'>Let's see how many more lengths we need, given what we already\
  \ have. We have mass worked</span> <span m='422300'>out, we have two lengths here\
  \ over three lengths so we have mass per length. So we have length</span> <span\
  \ m='428129'>to the minus one so far.</span> <span m='431619'>And what about time?\
  \ Well, we have no times yet except in these question marks so we need</span> <span\
  \ m='436949'>to get two more times on the bottom two more lengths on the top. So\
  \ we need to multiply</span> <span m='442279'>by length squared over time squared,\
  \ and the only way to do that is to make this exponent</span> <span m='447930'>a\
  \ two... and this exponent here a zero.</span> <span m='452520'>You can pause the\
  \ video and go ahead and try other combinations of exponents. You'll find</span>\
  \ <span m='456819'>that none of them will get both length and time correct.</span>\
  \ <span m='466149'>So now we have all the exponents, we can actually enter that\
  \ into our force formula. Drag force</span> <span m='472279'>is proportional to\
  \ density to the first power, speed squared, area to the first power we</span> <span\
  \ m='478659'>got from our home experiment and viscosity here to the zeroth power.</span>\
  \ <span m='484399'>Now let's test our formula with a second demonstration and see\
  \ if it predicts this new situation.</span> <span m='489649'>We're gonna race four\
  \ small cones stacked on top of each other. One, two, three, four.</span> <span\
  \ m='495279'>So we stack them to make one small cone that is four times the mass\
  \ of the other small</span> <span m='499689'>cone. Next we're going to race them.</span>\
  \ <span m='501830'>But first, what's the drag force ratio between the small cone\
  \ and 4 small cones stacked together.</span> <span m='508779'>Pause the video and\
  \ use the formula to make a prediction.</span> <span m='515169'>The four cones weigh\
  \ four times as much as one cone so that's times four on the left</span> <span m='520419'>side.\
  \ What about the right side? Again, both contestants feel the same air density.\
  \ The</span> <span m='526560'>velocity ratio, that's what we're trying to figure\
  \ out, and let's see what all the other</span> <span m='530250'>pieces are. The\
  \ area; well here in this case, the stack of four has the same cross- sectional</span>\
  \ <span m='535519'>area as the one cone so that's just one. And the viscosity doesn't\
  \ matter. So, this factor</span> <span m='541399'>of four on the left side has to\
  \ be produced by the v squared; in other words, the v goes</span> <span m='547100'>up\
  \ by a factor of two so that when it's squared, you get a factor of four. That means\
  \ the correct</span> <span m='552810'>answer should be two to one.</span> <span\
  \ m='554779'>Now, let's test our prediction with a demonstration to check whether\
  \ nature behaves as we predict.</span> <span m='561980'>It looks like our prediction\
  \ was correct! Now we feel pretty confident that we can use</span> <span m='568100'>this\
  \ formula to try to figure out the fuel consumption of a car.</span> <span m='576500'>Let's\
  \ clean up our formula here just a bit and erase the viscosity since it comes in</span>\
  \ <span m='580180'>with a zero exponent so it doesn't matter. And this is our drag\
  \ formula, which we're</span> <span m='584899'>gonna use to estimate the fuel consumption\
  \ of a car on the highway.</span> <span m='589769'>Fuel efficiency is measured as\
  \ the distance that that the car travels on one gallon or</span> <span m='593920'>liter\
  \ of gasoline.</span> <span m='597000'>So it depends on how much energy you can\
  \ get out of a gallon of gasoline divided by the</span> <span m='601139'>drag force,\
  \ which is the formula we've just found.</span> <span m='606449'>So let's put in\
  \ some numbers. What's the energy from a gallon of gasoline? A gallon is roughly</span>\
  \ <span m='613389'>4 liters. And gasoline is roughly like water so, there are 1,000g/liter.</span>\
  \ <span m='620329'>How much energy do you get out of each gram of gasoline? Gasoline\
  \ is like fat and from</span> <span m='625220'>the side of a butter packet, you\
  \ can read that 100 kilocalories, 10 to the 2 kilocalories</span> <span m='630639'>come\
  \ from 11 grams of butter.</span> <span m='633509'>But now we want to convert kilocalories\
  \ to some reasonable metric unit. So that's four</span> <span m='638170'>joules/calorie\
  \ or four kilojoules per kilocalorie. And that all divided by the drag force so</span>\
  \ <span m='646910'>let's put in those terms one by one.</span> <span m='650470'>First\
  \ the density here, one kilogram per meter cubed is the density of air roughly.\
  \ Now v</span> <span m='656660'>for highway speeds. Say 100 kilometers an hour,\
  \ 65 miles an hour. That's roughly 30</span> <span m='663060'>meters per second.\
  \ Don't forget to square it. And then the area of a car. Well, it's</span> <span\
  \ m='668329'>about... two meters wide by 1.5 meters high. Now we have to work all\
  \ the numbers, but before</span> <span m='676550'>you do that, pause the video to\
  \ check that the dimensions all cancel appropriately.</span> <span m='687290'>You\
  \ should have found that the result has units of meters, which is good! But how\
  \ many?</span> <span m='692550'>A quick numerical approximation will tell you that\
  \ you get 50 kilometers, which is 30</span> <span m='697959'>miles roughly. The\
  \ fuel efficiency of a car on the highway is about 30 miles per gallon;</span> <span\
  \ m='705129'>or 50 kilometers per gallon. In typical European Union units, that's\
  \ eight liters per hundred</span> <span m='712319'>kilometers.To Review With our\
  \ approximation methods, we've come to pretty reasonable numbers</span> <span m='721189'>for\
  \ the fuel efficiency of a car, without having to solve any of the complicated equations</span>\
  \ <span m='725519'>of fluid mechanics. Instead, we used one simple home experiment,\
  \ dropping the cones, and the</span> <span m='730910'>powerful principle of dimensional\
  \ analysis. From that, we were able to find all the exponents</span> <span m='737699'>here,\
  \ in the relationship between drag and density, speed, and cross-sectional area.</span>\
  \ <span m='743579'>So the moral of this is that there is an art to approximations,\
  \ and reasoning tools such</span> <span m='748560'>as dimensional analysis, they\
  \ give you an understanding of how systems behave without</span> <span m='752949'>having\
  \ to solve every single last bit of the detailed mathematics. This understanding\
  \ allows</span> <span m='758449'>us to redesign the world.</span> </p>"
