title: Models of Light
transcript: "<p><span m='3600'> What is light? Scientists have been trying to answer\
  \ this question for hundreds of years.</span> <span m='9129'>The process goes a\
  \ little like this: we set up an experiment and make observations about</span> <span\
  \ m='14049'>what light does. Then, using the data from our experiment and all the\
  \ previous experiments,</span> <span m='20100'>we make a model\u2014or models\u2014\
  of what we think light is. This process continues as more experiments</span> <span\
  \ m='26170'>are done and the models are refined. In this video, we'll use everything\
  \ we know about</span> <span m='31190'>what light does to explain the different\
  \ models of what light is.</span> <span m='37629'>This video is part of the Representations\
  \ video series. Information can be represented</span> <span m='41760'>in words,\
  \ through mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D models. Representations are\
  \ used</span> <span m='47839'>to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding\
  \ of objects, systems, and processes.</span> <span m='53920'>Hello. My name is Paola\
  \ Rebusco. I am a physics instructor in the Experimental Studies Group</span> <span\
  \ m='60299'>at MIT. Today I'll be talking with you about different models of light.</span>\
  \ <span m='67750'>In order to understand this video, you'll need to be familiar\
  \ with the electromagnetic</span> <span m='72450'>spectrum\u2014particularly, the\
  \ idea that there are varieties of light that our eyes cannot</span> <span m='77640'>see.\
  \ You should also be familiar with the behavior of waves, especially diffraction</span>\
  \ <span m='84079'>and interference. Finally, you should have some experience solving\
  \ problems with collisions,</span> <span m='90579'>so that you better understand\
  \ how particles interact with each other.</span> <span m='96090'>After watching\
  \ this video, you should be able to explain the major models of light, and</span>\
  \ <span m='101320'>should also be able to explain the different facets of light\
  \ in terms the models that best</span> <span m='106869'>describe them. This video\
  \ should also help you to understand how models are used and</span> <span m='112158'>verified\
  \ in science.</span> <span m='114929'>Let's start by looking at the things that\
  \ light does. We cannot expect to describe what</span> <span m='121109'>light is\
  \ without having a good picture of its behavior. We are going to make a list</span>\
  \ <span m='126990'>and refer to it later, so be sure to take notes. First, we know\
  \ that light moves very</span> <span m='134140'>quickly.</span> <span m='136220'>When\
  \ it reaches an object, light can interact in many ways. It might be transmitted\
  \ through</span> <span m='141700'>the object, be reflected off, or be absorbed.</span>\
  \ <span m='146930'>However, beams of light that pass through each other come out\
  \ unchanged.</span> <span m='153750'>Light can refract, changing directions as it\
  \ moves from one material to another.</span> <span m='159300'>It can also diffract\
  \ as it passes through small openings.</span> <span m='164100'>When light passes\
  \ by a charged particle, it can make that particle oscillate back and</span> <span\
  \ m='169060'>forth.</span> <span m='170430'>There are many kinds of light, some\
  \ of them invisible to us.</span> <span m='177010'>It can strip electrons away from\
  \ atoms, ionizing them almost instantly.</span> <span m='183650'>Light can collide\
  \ with particles.</span> <span m='186010'>Finally, light can transfer energy and\
  \ momentum almost instantaneously, but it can also do</span> <span m='192150'>so\
  \ in a gradual way. Some of the atomic-scale phenomena listed are actually the reason\
  \ for</span> <span m='201110'>the macroscopic phenomena. For instance, light that\
  \ strips away electrons from atoms is absorbed</span> <span m='207650'>in the process.</span>\
  \ <span m='210010'>Take a moment to make sure you have all of this in your notes.\
  \ These observations can</span> <span m='220170'>help us create a model for light.\
  \ When we talk about \"what light is,\" what we're really</span> <span m='226320'>doing\
  \ is creating a model. A model in physics is a representation -- a mental analogy\
  \ that</span> <span m='233230'>we can use to better understand the physical world.\
  \ Once we have a model, we can predict</span> <span m='240240'>the behavior of an\
  \ object or phenomenon based on the ways that the model would behave.</span> <span\
  \ m='246930'>It's important to understand that no model is perfect -- all models\
  \ go through cycles</span> <span m='252040'>of testing and refinement. There are\
  \ typically conditions under which a model can break down,</span> <span m='259570'>giving\
  \ incorrect results. However, because models are just analogies, we often create</span>\
  \ <span m='265710'>a new and improved one to better describe how something works.\
  \ A single phenomenon can</span> <span m='271660'>be modeled in many different ways,\
  \ with different assumptions or simplifications. Therefore,</span> <span m='278880'>we\
  \ can even use more than one model for the same thing. To give an example, imagine\
  \ describing</span> <span m='285750'>gravity as an invisible rope holding objects\
  \ together. There are several good things about</span> <span m='292720'>this model.\
  \ Ropes can only pull, not push, and this is true for gravity. Ropes can be</span>\
  \ <span m='301000'>used to swing objects in curved paths, the same way that gravity\
  \ makes the planets move</span> <span m='306650'>in curved paths.</span> <span m='308670'>Unfortunately,\
  \ the model breaks down quickly. The amount of force a rope exerts does not</span>\
  \ <span m='316870'>change with the length of the rope, whereas gravity's force definitely\
  \ does depend on</span> <span m='324790'>distance. Ropes can become tangled, whereas\
  \ gravity has nothing to tangle.</span> <span m='331590'>We can see that this model\
  \ works for some purposes, but not for others. Let's consider</span> <span m='337810'>some\
  \ of the things we might want to use to build our model for light. We know from\
  \ our</span> <span m='344659'>list that light can pass through other light, can\
  \ diffract and refract, and that it can</span> <span m='351190'>make charged particles\
  \ oscillate.</span> <span m='355330'>You may have heard light described in terms\
  \ of rays of light, or waves, or particles called</span> <span m='361419'>photons.\
  \ Which one of these models seems to fit these observations? Pause the video to</span>\
  \ <span m='370680'>consider.</span> <span m='372320'>If we consider waves, we know\
  \ that waves can pass through each other, that they diffract</span> <span m='384150'>and\
  \ refract, and that waves can make particles oscillate. These match the properties\
  \ of light</span> <span m='392480'>that we chose very well.</span> <span m='395490'>The\
  \ fact that light specifically makes charged particles oscillate is an indication\
  \ that</span> <span m='401470'>we are likely dealing with an electromagnetic phenomenon.\
  \ Therefore, we can model light</span> <span m='407790'>as an electromagnetic wave.\
  \ As you probably know, this is a common model for light. We</span> <span m='414960'>imagine\
  \ a situation similar to the animation shown to the right, where electromagnetic</span>\
  \ <span m='420850'>waves propagate in the direction that the light is shining. This\
  \ animation shows the</span> <span m='427830'>electric field vectors as the wave\
  \ moves to the right. Below is another image that shows</span> <span m='435290'>the\
  \ electric field in red and the magnetic field in blue, perpendicular to each other.</span>\
  \ <span m='441900'>However, there is a problem. Light cannot be just a wave. Let's\
  \ look at the reasons</span> <span m='448760'>why.</span> <span m='450310'>In addition\
  \ to the aspects that are wave-like, light has other properties. Light can also</span>\
  \ <span m='456699'>collide with particles of matter. Waves, on the other hand, move\
  \ through or around particles.</span> <span m='465889'>Light can transfer momentum\
  \ and energy almost instantaneously through these collisions;</span> <span m='472300'>waves\
  \ must transfer energy and momentum gradually. Finally, light can ionize atoms almost\
  \ instantly,</span> <span m='481520'>but electromagnetic waves would need more time\
  \ to do this because of that gradual energy</span> <span m='487270'>transfer.</span>\
  \ <span m='488210'>It is clear that light cannot be just a wave. Waves model some\
  \ aspects of light well, but</span> <span m='495669'>not others. How else might\
  \ we model light? Consider the aspects that we just discussed,</span> <span m='504040'>and\
  \ try to come up with an alternative model. Pause the video here to discuss.</span>\
  \ <span m='515419'>The other major model for light is the particle model. Particles\
  \ can collide with each other,</span> <span m='522299'>and in the process, they\
  \ transfer momentum and energy almost instantly. Through these</span> <span m='528329'>collisions,\
  \ they can quickly knock electrons loose from their atoms.</span> <span m='533569'>It\
  \ is because of this that a beam of light can also be modeled as a large number\
  \ of tiny</span> <span m='539660'>particles, called photons. If we return to our\
  \ list, we can see that some of the items,</span> <span m='546749'>shown in red,\
  \ are described well by the wave model. Others, shown in blue, are the items</span>\
  \ <span m='553629'>we just discussed for the particle model. We cannot deny that\
  \ light does all of these</span> <span m='560029'>things. Experiments show us that\
  \ it behaves like a particle in some ways, and like a wave</span> <span m='567019'>in\
  \ other ways. This leads to a phenomenon called \"wave-particle duality.\" In some\
  \ situations</span> <span m='575850'>light seems to behave in a manner predicted\
  \ by the wave model. At other times it behaves</span> <span m='582649'>in a particle-like\
  \ way. We cannot rely just on the wave model of light, or just on the</span> <span\
  \ m='589360'>particle model. Neither of our models works in every possible situation.\
  \ Scientists and</span> <span m='596670'>engineers typically set up situations to\
  \ take advantage of one model or the other, using</span> <span m='603149'>the particle-like\
  \ or wave-like behaviors of light to their advantage.</span> <span m='608879'>We\
  \ should also mention here that it's not just light that has the properties of both</span>\
  \ <span m='613929'>particles and waves. All things -- electrons, protons, any form\
  \ of matter -- can be made</span> <span m='621410'>to behave like particles or like\
  \ waves. This was one of the driving forces behind the development</span> <span\
  \ m='628160'>of quantum physics in the early 19th century. One of the most striking\
  \ experiments in this</span> <span m='634509'>area is the double-slit experiment,\
  \ in which light is directed towards a pair of thin slits</span> <span m='641199'>and\
  \ a pattern appears on a detecting screen.</span> <span m='644990'>The screen is\
  \ capable of detecting individual photons one at a time, which can be explained</span>\
  \ <span m='650860'>by the particle model.</span> <span m='653480'>However, the pattern\
  \ is created through the interference and diffraction of light, which</span> <span\
  \ m='659879'>can only be explained through the wave model. This experiment gives\
  \ the same results with</span> <span m='667610'>matter as with light. If we use\
  \ an electron source rather than a laser, we can create</span> <span m='674220'>a\
  \ beam of electrons forming the same pattern. This shows that matter can also be\
  \ represented</span> <span m='682139'>as a particle and as a wave. In the modern\
  \ view of quantum physics, objects are often</span> <span m='688740'>represented\
  \ as \"probability wave packets.\" These are localized collections of waves that</span>\
  \ <span m='695309'>describe where those objects may be found. The wavepacket approach\
  \ is more accurate than</span> <span m='702459'>the wave model or the particle model,\
  \ but is also difficult to fully understand and</span> <span m='707610'>to make\
  \ calculations with. The separate wave and particle models are both still in common</span>\
  \ <span m='713550'>use today. Models are useful for many purposes. Two of the most\
  \ common are describing the</span> <span m='722610'>mechanism for an existing phenomena\
  \ and predicting new phenomena that may be discovered. Rather</span> <span m='729259'>than\
  \ ask you to come up with entirely new predictions of what light might be able to</span>\
  \ <span m='733809'>do, we will instead look at some known phenomena that we have\
  \ not yet discussed.</span> <span m='740959'>Each of the four phenomena listed here\
  \ can be described using either the wave model or</span> <span m='745920'>the particle\
  \ model of light. Your professor will lead the class in a debate as to which</span>\
  \ <span m='751149'>model is most could best describe each phenomenon. Pause the\
  \ video here. Let's look at #3 on</span> <span m='763850'>that list: that an accelerating\
  \ electric charge can generate light. Would the wave model or</span> <span m='770379'>the\
  \ particle model predict this result?</span> <span m='774769'>The fact that an electric\
  \ charge is involved definitely points toward an electromagnetic</span> <span m='781350'>wave\
  \ description of light. We know that moving electric charges create both magnetic\
  \ and</span> <span m='788019'>electric fields. If our charge is accelerating, then\
  \ the fields that it creates must be changing.</span> <span m='795999'>As we learned\
  \ earlier in this course, changing electromagnetic fields obey a wave equation.</span>\
  \ <span m='802989'>It seems like this particular phenomenon is best described using\
  \ a wave model. Let's review.</span> <span m='810899'>The core idea for today's\
  \ video was the concept of a model. We saw that light can be modeled</span> <span\
  \ m='816999'>as an electromagnetic wave, or as a particle. Models like these are\
  \ used to describe existing</span> <span m='824429'>phenomena and to improve our\
  \ understanding. They can also be used to predict new phenomena.</span> <span m='831110'>I\
  \ hope you have enjoyed this introduction to light and wave-particle duality. Good\
  \ luck</span> <span m='837259'>in your further studies of physics.</span> </p>"
