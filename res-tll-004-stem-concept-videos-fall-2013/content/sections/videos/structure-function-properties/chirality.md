transcript: '<p><span m=''2639''>Have you ever wondered why the word Ambulance is
  printed as its mirror image on the front</span> <span m=''6970''>an Ambulance truck?
  The word is written this way so that drivers can read the word in their</span> <span
  m=''12039''>rearview mirror signaling them to pull over if necessary. In chemistry
  and biology, molecules</span> <span m=''18710''>can also be mirror image of each
  other and have very different functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''24800''>This video
  is part of the Structure-Function-Properties video series. The structure, function
  and</span> <span m=''31739''>properties of a system are related and depend on the
  processes that define or create the</span> <span m=''38780''>system.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''39859''>Hi, my name is Brad Pentelute, and I am a professor of chemistry at
  MIT. My research</span> <span m=''46629''>focuses on the biological properties of
  mirror-image proteins and how these macromolecules may</span> <span m=''52449''>be
  used in pharmaceutical applications and therapeutics.</span> </p><p><span m=''57179''>Before
  watching this video, you should be familiar with: Molecular Geometry, the structure</span>
  <span m=''62179''>of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, as well as have an
  understanding of what a</span> <span m=''67689''>protein is and its three-dimensional
  structure</span> <span m=''71729''>After watching this video, you will be able to:</span>
  <span m=''74700''>Identify chiral objects and molecules Understand how chirality
  plays a role in the</span> <span m=''79549''>function of biological compounds.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''87520''>Let''s begin by talking about chirality. In this video,
  you''ll see that chirality is an</span> <span m=''92469''>important feature in biological
  molecules because molecular structure is often closely</span> <span m=''97770''>related
  to biological function.</span> </p><p><span m=''100780''>A molecule is chiral if
  it is not superimposable with its mirror image. But, before we talk</span> <span
  m=''115060''>about chirality in molecules, let''s first look at a couple of ordinary
  objects to learn</span> <span m=''150489''>exactly what we mean by the term, chirality.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''154480''>Let''s look at a common example of chirality in this left
  and right glove. Gloves are mirror</span> <span m=''159390''>images of one another.
  The gloves look identical but we know from experience that they are</span> <span
  m=''164510''>not the same. They have different shapes. One fits only your left hand
  and the other</span> <span m=''170150''>fits only your right hand. If we try to
  lay the right glove on top of the left glove and</span> <span m=''176579''>align
  their key features, we see that they are not superimposable at all. Because left</span>
  <span m=''182450''>and right gloves are non-superimposable mirror images, we can
  say that gloves are chiral.</span> </p><p><span m=''187980''>Are there other objects
  that you can think of that are chiral? Please pause the video</span> <span m=''193480''>here
  to think of a few examples.</span> </p><p><span m=''202390''>You may have suggested
  such objects as your left or right ears, a drinking fountain, or</span> <span m=''207319''>a
  screw.</span> </p><p><span m=''209900''>Let''s look at this airplane. Is it chiral?
  If we take the airplane and compare it to</span> <span m=''214180''>its mirror image,
  we can see that the two images are identical and are superimposable.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''220640''>Therefore, the airplane is not chiral. Can you describe what characteristic
  of the airplane</span> <span m=''226180''>makes it achiral? Please pause the video
  and give a possible answer.</span> </p><p><span m=''237340''>There is a plane of
  symmetry through the center of the airplane itself. If one half of an</span> <span
  m=''241900''>object can be reflected onto its other half, then the object is never
  chiral. Can you think</span> <span m=''248150''>of another object with an internal
  plane of symmetry? Please pause the video and try to</span> <span m=''253260''>think
  of other achiral objects and where the internal plane of symmetry would be.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''264880''>Objects such as a chair, a drinking glass, and a fork
  have an internal plane of symmetry</span> <span m=''270630''>and hence are achiral.
  The planes of symmetry are here, here, and here.</span> </p><p><span m=''278720''>Notice
  that there is no way to divide a right-handed glove into two equal halves, which
  is why</span> <span m=''283850''>the glove is chiral.</span> </p><p><span m=''285690''>Finally,
  another everyday object that I want to show you is this fan. First, let''s think.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''292700''>Do you think a fan is chiral? Please pause the video and
  discuss this with a friend.</span> </p><p><span m=''304860''>Is the fan chiral?
  Yes, it is. Each blade is hung with a tilt that makes the fan chiral!</span> </p><p><span
  m=''311860''>The function of the tilted blades pushes air forward to create a wind
  chill effect to cool</span> <span m=''316510''>you. However, the tilted blades also
  cause the fan to be non-superimposable with its</span> <span m=''322540''>mirror
  image. As you can see, the mirror image has blades that tilt in the opposite direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''329670''>All objects can be classified as chiral or achiral, including
  molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''338909''>As with objects, a molecule is chiral
  if it is non-superimposable with its mirror image.</span> </p><p><span m=''344550''>The
  mirror image of a chiral molecule is called its enantiomer. Enantio is Greek for
  opposite</span> <span m=''352240''>and the term enantiomer describes the relationship
  between the two molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''356490''>Enantiomers have identical
  molecular formulas and have the same chemical connectivity but</span> <span m=''357190''>differ
  in the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the atoms in the molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''357880''>Let''s look at this model of the molecule, bromo-chloro-iodo
  methane. The green ball</span> <span m=''363400''>represents a chlorine atom, the
  orange ball represents a bromine atom, the purple ball</span> <span m=''368770''>represents
  an iodine atom and the white ball represents a hydrogen atom.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''374660''>If we take our molecule and hold it in front of a mirror, we see the
  molecule and its image</span> <span m=''379870''>in the mirror. But, now let''s
  look at 3-D models of both our original molecule and its</span> <span m=''385810''>mirror
  image. We see that the two are not superimposable, regardless of how one rotates</span>
  <span m=''391900''>the molecules. Hence, this tells us that bromo-chloro-iodo methane
  is a chiral molecule.</span> </p><p><span m=''410880''>A quick way to know if a
  molecule is chiral is to check and see if it has a chiral center.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''416440''>A chiral center is a tetrahedral atom attached to four different atoms
  or groups. The tetrahedral</span> <span m=''422910''>atom is usually carbon.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''426040''>Let''s make a model of the organic compound, 2-chlorobutane.
  The number 2 in front of the</span> <span m=''432690''>compound name means that
  chlorine is on the second carbon atom. This carbon is attached</span> <span m=''438060''>to
  four different groups, chlorine, hydrogen, a -CH3 group and a -CH2CH3 group and
  that</span> <span m=''444030''>means that it''s a chiral center. What would happen
  to the chirality of this</span> <span m=''448770''>compound if we substituted the
  hydrogen atom with a second chlorine atom? Would the resulting</span> <span m=''453990''>molecule
  be chiral? Please pause the video here.</span> </p><p><span m=''464930''>This new
  molecule, called 2, 2 di-chlorobutane is not chiral. The second carbon with two</span>
  <span m=''471360''>chlorine atoms no longer has four different groups attached.
  You can even see that this</span> <span m=''477080''>molecule has an internal plane
  of symmetry and therefore can be superimposable on its</span> <span m=''482630''>mirror
  image. When we do have a chiral molecule, sometimes</span> <span m=''490630''>its
  enantiomer has an entirely different function. For example, the enantiomers of Carvone
  are</span> <span m=''496850''>the flavors of caraway and spearmint. One enantiomer
  of Carvone fits into a specific</span> <span m=''502300''>receptor in your nose
  only in the way a left-handed glove fits your left hand. The other enantiomer</span>
  <span m=''507890''>of carvone fits into an entirely different receptor, resulting
  in the different odor.Many</span> <span m=''512570''>drugs such as the pain reliever,
  ibuprofen has biological activity while its enantiomer</span> <span m=''513890''>As
  with simple molecules, it is possible for proteins to exist that are mirror images
  of</span> <span m=''518659''>each other. However, this doesn''t occur in nature.
  Naturally occurring proteins are composed</span> <span m=''524660''>of L-amino acids
  only. It is not clear why nature selected for this particular enantiomer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''531660''>Selection of L-amino acids has structural consequences
  for a proteins three-dimensional</span> <span m=''536060''>shape.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''537490''>Pause the video here and discuss with a friend the general structure
  of amino acids. What</span> <span m=''542240''>are the groups attached to the central
  carbon? Which if any of the amino acids are achiral?</span> </p><p><span m=''552220''>An
  amino acid contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group. It also contains</span>
  <span m=''557890''>a hydrogen atom and a sidechain. The central atom is carbon.
  Of the 20 naturally occurring</span> <span m=''564940''>amino acids, glycine is
  the only achiral amino acid. Its sidechain is a second hydrogen atom.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''573250''>The remaining 19 amino acids have the L configuration.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''578720''>Let us recall that naturally occurring amino acids have an L-configuration
  and combine</span> <span m=''583350''>to form L-proteins. However, scientists can
  now chemically synthesize proteins made up</span> <span m=''589000''>entirely of
  D-amino acids. These synthetic macromolecules are also known as D-proteins.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''595090''>Interestingly, these proteins fold into three- dimensional
  structures, which mirror those</span> <span m=''600960''>of the naturally occurring
  L-protein counter-part.</span> </p><p><span m=''610500''>Snow fleas are a species
  of dark blue insect. They are often seen bouncing around on the</span> <span m=''615000''>snow
  in the winter. Ice fish live in the Antarctic. These fish live in the ocean at subzero
  temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m=''620860''>What do the snow flea and the arctic
  fish have in common? They can both survive in subfreezing</span> <span m=''626940''>temperatures.
  How do they do this? Both creatures make a class of proteins called Antifreeze</span>
  <span m=''632840''>proteins. These proteins protect these organisms and others,
  including moths, beetles, plants</span> <span m=''639570''>and even bacteria by
  binding to water and stopping the growth of ice crystals in their</span> <span m=''644930''>bodies.
  Is water chiral? Please pause the video here</span> <span m=''649340''>and try to
  answer this question.</span> </p><p><span m=''657300''>Here you can see the chemical
  structure of water. As you can see, it has two planes of</span> <span m=''662000''>symmetry,
  and water is superimposable with its own mirror image.</span> </p><p><span m=''669250''>The
  antifreeze protein is comprised of 81 amino acids folded into six helices. Each</span>
  <span m=''676230''>helix is connected by amino acids that form a short connecting
  loop. The helices in the</span> <span m=''682290''>antifreeze protein are left-handed.
  Do you think the helices are chiral? Pause the video</span> <span m=''687830''>and
  discuss this with a friend.</span> </p><p><span m=''696370''>The helix winds up
  in the direction of your left thumb when your fingers are curled in</span> <span
  m=''700460''>to make a fist. These helices do not have an internal plane of symmetry,
  and are not</span> <span m=''706360''>superimposable with their mirror images. They
  are chiral.</span> </p><p><span m=''711290''>The antifreeze protein was the first
  protein whose mirror image was chemically synthesized.</span> </p><p><span m=''718650''>The
  mirror image protein is composed of entirely D-amino acids. The helices are right-handed,</span>
  <span m=''724930''>opposite to that of the naturally occurring protein. They wind
  up in the direction of</span> <span m=''729870''>your right thumb when your fingers
  are curled in to make a fist. In proteins, we see chirality</span> <span m=''736460''>in
  the amino acid units and in the secondary structure as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''741300''>Do you think the D-form of the antifreeze protein will have a function
  the same as or</span> <span m=''745420''>different from the natural L-form? Please
  pause the video here and discuss with a friend.</span> </p><p><span m=''754920''>Interestingly,
  the mirror image protein has the same antifreeze properties. This is because</span>
  <span m=''764060''>its binding partner, water is achiral. So the mirror image protein
  can still bind water.</span> </p><p><span m=''774170''>Hopefully by now you have
  the tools to recognize chiral objects and molecules, and the role</span> <span m=''779240''>that
  chirality can play in recognition and specificity between biological systems. In</span>
  <span m=''785610''>this video, we saw that an object or molecule is chiral if it
  cannot be superimposed onto</span> <span m=''791590''>its mirror image. Objects
  or molecules that have an internal plane of symmetry are never</span> <span m=''798190''>chiral.
  We also talked about enantiomers, which are the mirror image of a chiral molecule.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''804750''>Since the spatial orientation of the atoms in enantiomers
  are different, chiral compounds</span> <span m=''810620''>can and often do have
  distinct functions. But, as you saw with the antifreeze protein,</span> <span m=''815430''>sometimes
  there are exceptions to the rule!</span> </p>'
