Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Identify errors in free body diagrams and correct them. Recognize free body diagrams as representations of forces, and connect them with real world objects and phenomena.

Students are asked to explain various phenomena in terms of which model describe them most effectively. The video also touches on wave-particle duality, through the double-slit experiment, and its application to both light and matter. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Explain the major models of light. Explain the different facets of light in terms of those models. Understand how models are used in science.

The centripetal and Coriolis accelerations that arise in rotating frames of reference are explored. Finally, we use the Coriolis effect to explain the rotational direction of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Explain why centripetal and Coriolis accelerations arise in rotating frames of reference. Apply their understanding of the Coriolis acceleration to determine the direction of rotation of hurricanes.

The primary context is balance in the human body. Students are involved in partner activities, brainstorms, and problem-solving segments as the video progresses. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Draw torque diagrams Practice setting up torque problems Determine whether someone can balance Funding provided by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Developed by the Teaching and Learning Laboratory (TLL) at MIT for SUTD MIT © 2012" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/2HpF8R_cjR8/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/videos/representations/vectors" section="Representations" title="Vectors" description="Summary This video consists of four chapters: an introduction to the concept of the vector, a brief review of vector properties, an exploration of vector properties using physical intuition based on displacements, and finally, a discussion of how to recognize when a physical quantity can be represented by a vector, which works through the example of force and the non-example of rotation. Learning Objectives By the end of this video, students will be able to: Understand the properties of vectors by using displacement as an example Determine whether a physical quantity can be represented using vectors Funding provided by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) Developed by the Teaching and Learning Laboratory (TLL) at MIT for SUTD MIT © 2012" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/mVQOmLTXLbQ/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/videos/representations/vector-fields" section="Representations" title="Vector Fields" description="Summary This video takes a look at a smoke probe visualization of airflow over a model of an F16 aircraft. The visualization is created in the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel. Two flow regimes are shown. The first is a low angle of attack visualization, where the flow field appears steady, or independent of time. The second flow regime has the model at a high angle of attack. In this case, the flow appears unsteady, which shows that the flow field has a time dependence. Prof. Dave Darmofal ends the demonstration by discussing how these visualizations are used in engineering. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Understand that flow quantities around bodies are often analyzed in Eulerian frame. Recognize that flow velocity is a vector field, which can be a function of space or a function of space and time.

She walks students through a series of examples to help students translate 2D Lewis structures into 3D molecular geometries using the VSEPR model. Opportunities for pausing the video are provided so that students may construct 3D molecular models alongside the video. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Use the VSEPR model to predict 3D molecular structures from 2D Lewis structures. Discuss some of the assumptions and limitations of the VSEPR model.
