title: Gravity
transcript: "<p><span m='2550'> You know gravity as the force that keeps us from falling\
  \ off this planet. But it's so</span> <span m='7380'>much more than that. Gravity\
  \ predicts the formation of planets, explains why they are</span> <span m='11890'>spherical\
  \ and why the orbits of planets around the sun are elliptical. It helped us discover</span>\
  \ <span m='17500'>one of the planets in our own solar system, and the formation\
  \ of Saturn\u2019s rings. Gravity</span> <span m='22689'>can bend and even trap\
  \ light, and it governs some of the behavior of the universe itself.</span> <span\
  \ m='28470'>In this video, we\u2019ll look at the different models of gravity and\
  \ explore how each helps</span> <span m='32529'>us understand these diverse phenomena.</span>\
  \ <span m='35440'>This video is part of the Governing Rules video series. A small\
  \ number of rules describe</span> <span m='39850'>the physical and chemical interactions\
  \ that are possible in our universe.</span> <span m='44149'>Hello. My name is Nergis\
  \ Mavalvala. I am a professor in the physics department at MIT,</span> <span m='50519'>and\
  \ today I'll be talking with you about gravity.</span> <span m='53769'>After watching\
  \ this video, you should be able to recognize several different expressions</span>\
  \ <span m='58890'>for gravity, and to analyze situations involving gravity in preparation\
  \ for problem-solving.</span> <span m='65059'>We also hope that you gain an appreciation\
  \ for the universal nature of gravity and the</span> <span m='69640'>many places\
  \ its effects can be seen.</span> <span m='72730'>There are three expressions of\
  \ gravity that scientists find useful. We're going to talk</span> <span m='77110'>about\
  \ all three of them today: gravity near the earth's surface, Newton's universal\
  \ law</span> <span m='83120'>of gravity, and Einstein's gravitational field equations,\
  \ which are the core of general relativity.</span> <span m='89720'>We'll be spending\
  \ most of our time with the second one, but we're going to start with</span> <span\
  \ m='94110'>the simplest item and build upward and outward from there. You should\
  \ make sure that the</span> <span m='99190'>first two equations are in your notes.</span>\
  \ <span m='102560'>Let's start with the basics: gravity near Earth's surface. In\
  \ studying Newton's Laws</span> <span m='108310'>we all learn that F = ma. Near\
  \ Earth's surface, that \"a,\" acceleration, is provided by Earth's</span> <span\
  \ m='116450'>gravity. The value is almost constant, so we use this small \"g\" constant\
  \ to represent</span> <span m='122060'>it.</span> <span m='123520'>We're all familiar\
  \ with the most basic applications of gravity - that we stay on the ground, that</span>\
  \ <span m='130360'>objects fall downward, that we have to work harder walking up\
  \ a hill than down.</span> <span m='136520'>There are also many applications of\
  \ gravity that are hidden from us in our day-to-day</span> <span m='140480'>experience.\
  \ For instance, elevators use counterweights to ease the load on the motor. As gravity</span>\
  \ <span m='148110'>pulls on the counterweight, the tension it puts on the cable\
  \ pulls the elevator upward</span> <span m='153420'>and helps to balance the force\
  \ of gravity on the elevator itself.</span> <span m='159480'>Some older mountain\
  \ railways also use counterbalancing, with one train car moving upward as the other</span>\
  \ <span m='166030'>moves down.</span> <span m='168280'>Pile drivers are construction\
  \ machines that rely on the pull of gravity to slam large</span> <span m='173010'>weights\
  \ into the ground, digging holes and driving foundations for buildings.</span> <span\
  \ m='180709'>As useful as this simple view of gravity is, it's fairly limited -\
  \ it can't explain why</span> <span m='186650'>the planets are spherical instead\
  \ of, say, cube-shaped. It also can't explain the orbits</span> <span m='191459'>of\
  \ the planets, or the action of the tides. Let's move to a more complex expression\
  \ for</span> <span m='197050'>gravity that can help us understand these things.</span>\
  \ <span m='201800'>Newton's law of universal gravitation is a powerful model that\
  \ can explain many different</span> <span m='207110'>phenomena. Let's dive right\
  \ in.</span> <span m='211430'>Unlike the most basic view of gravity, in which it\
  \ pulls straight down, leaving Canadians</span> <span m='216709'>to wonder why penguins\
  \ don't fall off the planet, Newton's gravity shows that all objects</span> <span\
  \ m='222790'>are pulled toward each other's centers. Thus, we all stay firmly planted\
  \ on Earth's surface.</span> <span m='231050'>Because the gravitational force pulls\
  \ equally in all directions, large bodies in space tend</span> <span m='236099'>to\
  \ be spherical. The Sun, all planets, and even larger moons tend towards a spherical</span>\
  \ <span m='243130'>shape for this reason.</span> <span m='244950'>Newton's law of\
  \ gravity also means that all objects are pulled toward each other, such</span>\
  \ <span m='251069'>as planets toward the sun. By solving the differential equations\
  \ that come from this</span> <span m='256839'>law, we can obtain the elliptical\
  \ orbits that all planets have as they move around their</span> <span m='262370'>stars.</span>\
  \ <span m='263219'>We can get all sorts of ellipses, from the near-circles we see\
  \ in the inner planets,</span> <span m='269229'>to Pluto's elongated orbit, to comets\
  \ that swing far out of the solar system.</span> <span m='276479'>The smaller pulls\
  \ that planets have toward each other can be useful too. They're what</span> <span\
  \ m='282099'>allowed us to discover Neptune, by looking at the disturbances in the\
  \ orbit of Uranus.</span> <span m='288029'>Newton's law of gravity also gave us\
  \ new insight into events on Earth, like our tides. Objects</span> <span m='296449'>on\
  \ one side of the Earth are pulled more strongly toward the moon than objects on\
  \ the other</span> <span m='301439'>side, in a phenomenon called tidal forces.</span>\
  \ <span m='306699'>Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, has gravitational interactions\
  \ with other smaller galaxies nearby.</span> <span m='313999'>Its disc-like shape\
  \ and spiral arms may have come from tearing those galaxies apart.</span> <span\
  \ m='320620'>We see other galaxies colliding in many other places in the universe,\
  \ as gravity pulls them</span> <span m='325930'>together. It actually seems to be\
  \ fairly common.</span> <span m='330259'>Speaking of galaxies, Newton's law also\
  \ tells us how fast galaxies should rotate. We can</span> <span m='336819'>predict\
  \ a particular A curve for how fast the stars will be moving according to their</span>\
  \ <span m='341860'>distance from the center - that's curve A here. But when we measure\
  \ the actual velocity</span> <span m='348009'>of those stars, we get B curve B instead.\
  \ This was our first indication of the existence</span> <span m='354419'>of dark\
  \ matter - some sort of substance that produces gravity but doesn't interact with</span>\
  \ <span m='359990'>light. We couldn't see it, but we could see its effects. Dark\
  \ matter surrounds and is</span> <span m='366710'>part of every galaxy. In fact,\
  \ there's so much that it makes up most of the galaxy!</span> <span m='373430'>Physicists\
  \ are still trying to figure out what this dark matter might be.</span> <span m='378129'>We\
  \ can also use Newton's law of gravity to look beyond the structure of individual\
  \ galaxies</span> <span m='383669'>- we can look at clusters of galaxies, superclusters,\
  \ and even the entire visible universe.</span> <span m='392060'>Fair enough.</span>\
  \ <span m='394369'>When we do look at things on that scale, where individual galaxies\
  \ become just dots, we can</span> <span m='399529'>see massive structures of galaxies,\
  \ like this Great Wall here, or these empty intergalactic</span> <span m='405699'>voids.</span>\
  \ <span m='408419'>In recent years supercomputers have become powerful enough to\
  \ simulate the formation</span> <span m='413240'>of such structures in our universe.\
  \ Here you can see the result of one such simulation,</span> <span m='419210'>with\
  \ each speck of light representing a galaxy worth of stars or dark matter. Using\
  \ Newton's</span> <span m='425659'>law of gravity, superclusters of galaxies and\
  \ intergalactic voids appear naturally!</span> <span m='432110'>A real triumph of\
  \ Newton's approach was that it worked for everything from people on Earth</span>\
  \ <span m='439069'>out to some of the most distant objects we can see.</span> <span\
  \ m='444249'>But it couldn't handle everything, and that's why we need this next\
  \ part.</span> <span m='450270'>The most powerful model of gravity is described\
  \ by Einstein's field equations, which are the</span> <span m='455759'>core of general\
  \ relativity. This equation may not make sense to you now, but later in</span> <span\
  \ m='461589'>your career you may learn about something called tensors, which are\
  \ related to vectors.</span> <span m='467699'>In this equation, tensors describe\
  \ the gravitational effects of both matter and energy on all</span> <span m='473899'>things\
  \ around them. This equation is very hard to solve, even for experts. Some of the</span>\
  \ <span m='481649'>cases we know how to solve tell us about black holes and gravitational\
  \ lensing, and give</span> <span m='486830'>us insight into the universe when it\
  \ was very young.</span> <span m='493169'>Black holes were one of the first solutions\
  \ to Einstein's field equations. You've probably</span> <span m='498520'>heard of\
  \ black holes, which are objects so massive that they warp space and time, and</span>\
  \ <span m='504300'>even light cannot escape their gravitational pull.</span> <span\
  \ m='507589'>At the center of our galaxy, and of many large galaxies, are supermassive\
  \ black holes. We</span> <span m='515078'>can see their effects as stars near the\
  \ center of the galaxy whip around them at high speed.</span> <span m='522149'>While\
  \ black holes trap light, other massive objects can have an effect too. Light bends</span>\
  \ <span m='528060'>in its path as it moves past heavy objects like stars.</span>\
  \ <span m='532740'>This can lead to gravitational lensing, in which light from a\
  \ distant object is bent</span> <span m='537880'>around both sides of a heavy object.\
  \ This lets us see multiple views of an object, or</span> <span m='544240'>even\
  \ warped images.</span> <span m='546630'>Einstein's field equations also include\
  \ this lambda value: the cosmological constant.</span> <span m='553779'>This value\
  \ can be used to describe a universe that collapses or holds steady, expands slowly,</span>\
  \ <span m='560259'>or expands at an accelerating rate. Astronomers are working to\
  \ measure this value, and we</span> <span m='565949'>seem to be in the third case\
  \ - a universe that expands faster and faster.</span> <span m='572019'>Einstein's\
  \ theory of gravity remains one of the best-tested and most accurate theories</span>\
  \ <span m='576959'>in all of science. It can explain everything that Newtonian gravity\
  \ can and more, things</span> <span m='583410'>we wouldn't otherwise be able to\
  \ predict or understand, it can even make predictions about how</span> <span m='588589'>the\
  \ universe will end. You can see why people would be interested in studying it.</span>\
  \ <span m='594790'>These three gravitational equations describe a huge range of\
  \ phenomena in our natural world,</span> <span m='600860'>from things in our own\
  \ home to the farthest objects we can see. I hope that you will be</span> <span\
  \ m='606180'>motivated to learn more about them. Understanding these laws and being\
  \ able to use them will</span> <span m='611670'>lead you to a greater appreciation\
  \ of the natural world.</span> <span m='616160'>Now it's time to take some of the\
  \ examples we saw and examine them in a different way.</span> <span m='621740'>You\
  \ will need paper and something to write with for this part of the video.</span>\
  \ <span m='627550'>Knowing that gravity causes a particular phenomenon is good,\
  \ but we also want to know how to describe</span> <span m='633339'>these phenomena\
  \ mathematically.</span> <span m='635310'>We'll be giving you some situations that\
  \ can be described through gravity. Your job, working</span> <span m='642230'>in\
  \ pairs or groups of three, is to determine what information you would want in order\
  \ to</span> <span m='647889'>solve a particular problem.</span> <span m='650110'>For\
  \ instance, let's say that we drop a rock and want to know how long it would take\
  \ to</span> <span m='655319'>fall. We would want to know the rock's initial height\
  \ and whether air resistance would be</span> <span m='660339'>important. We might\
  \ also want to double-check the value for gravity on Earth.</span> <span m='666379'>That\
  \ example is pretty simple. Let's do a more complicated one. Given an asteroid headed</span>\
  \ <span m='673069'>toward Earth, and its velocity and location, which approach would\
  \ we need to find out whether</span> <span m='678860'>the asteroid will hit the\
  \ Earth, and if so, how long it will be before the impact?</span> <span m='685949'>To\
  \ understand an object's trajectory we need to know about its starting point - the\
  \ position</span> <span m='691509'>of the asteroid as compared to Earth. We also\
  \ want to know how fast it's moving and in what</span> <span m='697949'>direction.\
  \ We'll need to know the mass of the Earth and of the asteroid, because both</span>\
  \ <span m='702440'>will factor into the force applied on the asteroid.</span> <span\
  \ m='706860'>Some things are arbitrary choices - for instance, we can pick any coordinate\
  \ system we like.</span> <span m='712910'>Since gravity pulls objects together,\
  \ we might want to choose polar coordinates centered</span> <span m='717819'>on\
  \ the Earth to make things easier.</span> <span m='720199'>Finally, there are some\
  \ things that we'll want to know that are of a more general nature.</span> <span\
  \ m='725769'>For instance, how do we take into account gravity from the Sun? Can\
  \ we measure all of</span> <span m='731529'>our positions and velocities from the\
  \ Earth's reference frame as if it were moving with</span> <span m='736089'>constant\
  \ velocity? Should we track the Earth as it moves in its orbit?</span> <span m='741600'>These\
  \ are things we might not know when we start to solve a problem, and it's important</span>\
  \ <span m='745959'>to write them down.</span> <span m='747790'>Now it's your turn.\
  \ We'll put four problems on the screen. Your instructor will assign</span> <span\
  \ m='753230'>problems to different groups. Each group's job is to write up a list\
  \ of what information</span> <span m='758529'>you would need in order to solve the\
  \ problem. Remember, you don't need to actually solve</span> <span m='763819'>it\
  \ - just write down what you would need to know in order to find a solution.</span>\
  \ <span m='768649'>Here are the problems. Thank you for watching our video, and\
  \ good luck with your class.</span> </p>"
