This relationship is explored by modeling the process of diffusion using random walkers. Finally, this law is applied to other real-world scenarios involving solid state diffusion and thermodynamics. Learning Objectives After watching this video students should be able to: Recognize that the gradient vector points in the direction of maximum slope of a scalar function with magnitude equal to that slope. Describe the physicality of Fick’s first law as it applies to concentration gradients.

Alongside the video, students derive a rate equation (the Michaelis-Menten equation) for a simple enzyme-substrate system. Returning to the drug development example, students see that rate equations can help them infer information about reaction mechanisms. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Explain how enzymes affect reaction rates. Derive a rate law for a general enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

Students consider what the dominant inputs and outputs may be and see how simplifying assumptions make the differential equation easier to solve. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Construct a differential equation to estimate the concentration of a chemical in the environment. Appreciate how informed estimates can help simplify and solve these differential equations.

A variety of classical fluid flow environments are analyzed for the existence of curl. Finally, the connection between curl and momentum transfer in fluid flow are explored in the context of biological locomotion. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Understand curl as a measurement of the magnitude and direction of maximum circulation per unit area. Recognize curl in 2-dimensional fluid flows. Describe the relationship between curl and vorticity. Connect vorticity to momentum transfer for a collection of familiar physical phenomena.

The divergence of a vector field is defined physically, and the physical description is connected to the mathematical formula. Students analyze a collection of vector fields to determine whether or not they have positive, negative, or zero divergence by analyzing the change in area or volume of a region of tracer particles. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to determine points at which a vector field is divergent.
