transcript: "<p><span m='3439'> Suppose you get a text message. Your friend tells\
  \ you to go to Lobby 7 at MIT to find</span> <span m='7630'>the gift they left you\
  \ 7 meters from the center of the lobby. Is that enough information to</span> <span\
  \ m='12400'>find the gift right away? As you can see, there are many locations 7\
  \ meters from the</span> <span m='20000'>center of the room. Don't forget that we\
  \ live in 3 dimensions, so there are actually even</span> <span m='24010'>more points\
  \ 7 meters away from the center of the room. Fortunately, in this problem,</span>\
  \ <span m='28460'>you can ignore most of them since we don't expect our gift to\
  \ be hanging in mid air.</span> <span m='33280'>Distance alone wasn't enough information.\
  \ It would have been helpful to have both the</span> <span m='36960'>distance and\
  \ the direction.</span> <span m='41699'>This video is part of the Representations\
  \ video series. Information can be represented</span> <span m='45829'>in words,\
  \ through mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D models. Representations are\
  \ used</span> <span m='51909'>to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding\
  \ of objects, systems, and processes.</span> <span m='57309'>Hi, my name is Dan\
  \ Hastings and I am Dean of Undergraduate Education and a Professor</span> <span\
  \ m='63089'>of Engineering Systems, and Aeronautics and Astronautics here at MIT.\
  \ Today, I'd like</span> <span m='68470'>to talk to you about the utility of thinking\
  \ about displacements as vectors when trying</span> <span m='73050'>to recall vector\
  \ properties, and how you determine if a physical quantity can be represented</span>\
  \ <span m='78750'>using vectors.</span> <span m='80160'>Before watching this video,\
  \ you should know how to add and scale vectors. You should also</span> <span m='85789'>understand\
  \ how to decompose vectors, and how to find perpendicular basis vectors.</span>\
  \ <span m='91730'>After you watch this video, you will be able to understand the\
  \ properties of vectors by</span> <span m='95640'>using displacement as an example,\
  \ and you will be able to determine whether a physical</span> <span m='99750'>quantity\
  \ can be represented using vectors.</span> <span m='103990'>Meet the vector. The\
  \ vector is an object that has both magnitude and direction. One way</span> <span\
  \ m='111140'>to represent a vector is with an arrow. You have seen other algebraic\
  \ representations</span> <span m='116830'>of vectors as well. There are many physical\
  \ quantities that have both magnitude and direction.</span> <span m='122640'>Can\
  \ you think of some? Make a list of quantities that can be described by a magnitude\
  \ and direction.</span> <span m='128199'>Feel free to discuss your list with other\
  \ people. We'll come back to this list at the</span> <span m='132690'>end of the\
  \ video.</span> <span m='133090'>Pause the video here.</span> <span m='136090'>In\
  \ engineering, there are many physical quantities of interest that have both magnitude\
  \ and direction.</span> <span m='145260'>Consider the following example: Here you\
  \ see a video of airflow over the wing of an F16</span> <span m='151120'>fighter\
  \ jet model in the Wright Brothers wind tunnel at MIT. The air that flows over the</span>\
  \ <span m='155760'>wing has both speed and direction. The direction is always tangent\
  \ to the path of the airflow.</span> <span m='160940'>We can represent the air velocity\
  \ with an arrow at each point around the wing. The length</span> <span m='162390'>of\
  \ the arrow represents speed, and the direction represents the direction of motion.\
  \ Such a</span> <span m='167079'>collection of vectors is called a vector field.\
  \ The vector field of airflow over the wing</span> <span m='171780'>creates a lift\
  \ force via the Bernoulli effect. This effect suggests that because the horizontal</span>\
  \ <span m='177020'>component of the airflow velocity is the same throughout the\
  \ flow field, the air flowing</span> <span m='181200'>over the wing is moving faster\
  \ than the air flowing beneath the wing. This creates a difference</span> <span\
  \ m='185940'>in air pressure, which provides the lift force, another physical quantity\
  \ that we can represent</span> <span m='191410'>with a vector. Depending on the\
  \ angle of the wing, the magnitude and direction of the lift</span> <span m='196770'>force\
  \ changes. Lift is just one example of a vector quantity that is very important\
  \ in</span> <span m='201530'>designing aircraft. We are quite used to thinking of\
  \ forces as vectors, but do forces exhibit</span> <span m='207550'>the properties\
  \ necessary to be aptly represented by vectors? Let's review the properties of</span>\
  \ <span m='213380'>the vector.</span> <span m='218569'>To add vector b to vector\
  \ a, we connect the tail of b to the tip of a and the sum is the</span> <span m='224900'>vector\
  \ that connects the tail of a to the tip of b. An important property of vector</span>\
  \ <span m='229819'>addition is that it is commutative. That is a + b = b + a. You\
  \ can see this visually from</span> <span m='236400'>the parallelogram whose diagonal\
  \ represents both sums simultaneously. Another important</span> <span m='243300'>property\
  \ is that vectors can be multiplied by real numbers, which are called scalars,</span>\
  \ <span m='248030'>because they have the effect of scaling the length of the vector.\
  \ Multiplying by positive</span> <span m='252150'>scalars increases the length for\
  \ large scalars, and shrinks the vector for scalars less than</span> <span m='257699'>one.\
  \ Multiplying a vector by -1 has the effect of making the vector point in the opposite</span>\
  \ <span m='262970'>direction. Another important property of vectors is that the\
  \ initial point doesn't matter.</span> <span m='269220'>Any vector pointing in the\
  \ same direction with the same magnitude represents the same</span> <span m='273380'>vector.\
  \ To make this seem less abstract, we can think of vector properties in terms of</span>\
  \ <span m='278770'>displacement.</span> <span m='285750'>Suppose you walk from a\
  \ point P to a point Q. The displacement, or change is position</span> <span m='292110'>from\
  \ P to Q, is aptly represented by an arrow that starts at the point P and ends at\
  \ the</span> <span m='297639'>point Q. Let's see how displacement motivates the\
  \ correct form of vector addition. Consider</span> <span m='303590'>the following\
  \ example: you start at home, which is represented by a star on the map.</span>\
  \ <span m='307560'>You walk 300 meters east to get a cup of tea before you walk\
  \ southeast 500 meters to school.</span> <span m='314050'>After class you walk 400\
  \ meters southwest of your school to play tennis. Your friend,</span> <span m='319300'>who\
  \ lives in your apartment complex, is going to meet you there. What vector would\
  \ represent</span> <span m='323990'>the displacement vector for your friend who\
  \ leaves home directly and meets you to play</span> <span m='328690'>tennis? Pause\
  \ the video here and discuss your answer with someone. Answer: The vector that</span>\
  \ <span m='341430'>starts at your home and moves down to the tennis court. This\
  \ is interesting because</span> <span m='346199'>the arrow that connects your starting\
  \ location to your ending location represents the total</span> <span m='350620'>displacement\
  \ from your starting point. In other words, this vector is the sum of the</span>\
  \ <span m='355389'>other 3 displacement vectors. Displacement also helps you understand\
  \ vector decomposition.</span> <span m='362080'>Suppose you have walked a few blocks\
  \ away, represented by the following displacement.</span> <span m='366910'>To get\
  \ there, you probably didn't walk through other people's houses and yards. Your\
  \ path</span> <span m='371210'>more likely looked something like this. This process\
  \ of breaking a vector down into component</span> <span m='377389'>parts pointing\
  \ along particular directions is completely analogous to decomposing a vector</span>\
  \ <span m='382780'>into components that point along perpendicular basis vectors.\
  \ When in doubt about the mathematics</span> <span m='388639'>of the vector, take\
  \ a moment to rephrase your problem in terms of displacements, and see</span> <span\
  \ m='393240'>if your intuition can guide the mathematics.</span> <span m='399110'>Now,\
  \ let's go back to forces -- do they have the vector properties that we expect them</span>\
  \ <span m='406540'>to? When representing physical quantities with vectors, the quantity\
  \ must have both</span> <span m='411830'>magnitude and direction. But it must also\
  \ scale and add commutatively. Let's see if</span> <span m='417340'>force has these\
  \ properties. Force seems to have magnitude and direction. Force also scales</span>\
  \ <span m='419320'>appropriately. We think of forces as being small or large, we\
  \ can increase them and decrease</span> <span m='423770'>them. When we draw a free\
  \ body diagram, we are implicitly assuming that forces are vectors,</span> <span\
  \ m='434150'>and that they add like vectors. But how do we know this? We do an experiment.\
  \ In this</span> <span m='440210'>next segment we'll see a demonstration of how\
  \ forces, do indeed, add like vectors. [Pause]</span> <span m='447160'>Here you\
  \ see 3 Newton Scales connected by strings. We'll call the two strings on top</span>\
  \ <span m='451979'>String A and String B.</span> <span m='454100'>String A is 135\
  \ degrees off of horizontal.</span> <span m='458120'>String B is 45 degrees off\
  \ of horizontal. The scale reads out the magnitude of the tension</span> <span m='464770'>force\
  \ on each string.</span> <span m='466250'>We first want to get a reading of the\
  \ scales while there is no mass added to the system.</span> <span m='471009'>The\
  \ scales do not have very precise measurement; we can only guarantee the measurement\
  \ to within</span> <span m='476610'>.5 Newtons.</span> <span m='478120'>When looking\
  \ at the bottom scale, we see that the reading is approximately -.3 Newtons.</span>\
  \ <span m='485180'>The tension on string A is approximately .5 Newtons, and the\
  \ tension on string B is .3</span> <span m='493259'>Newtons. These tension forces\
  \ are due to the weight of the bottom scale and the strings.</span> <span m='498069'>So\
  \ we will need to subtract these amounts off of any reading when mass is added into</span>\
  \ <span m='501940'>the system to get the tension force of the mass alone.</span>\
  \ <span m='506440'>Let's add a 1kg mass to the hook below the bottom scale. The\
  \ bottom scale now reads about</span> <span m='512639'>9.6 Newtons. Now we look\
  \ at the top two scales. We see that the tension force on string A</span> <span\
  \ m='519559'>is 7.4 Newtons, and the tension on string B is 7.5 Newtons. We want\
  \ to decompose these</span> <span m='529700'>forces to see if they do in fact add\
  \ like vectors. Note that Newton's second law says</span> <span m='534640'>that\
  \ the sum of these forces must be zero, since our system of strings and scales is</span>\
  \ <span m='540260'>stationary.</span> <span m='541279'>Let's start by subtracting\
  \ off the readings we got from our Newton scale system with no</span> <span m='545540'>added\
  \ mass to find the net tension force due to the mass. The tension in the string\
  \ A is</span> <span m='551779'>7.4-.5 = 6.9 N. And the tension on string B is 7.5-.3=7.2\
  \ N. We find that the net force</span> <span m='565860'>down is 9.6-(-.3) = 9.9\
  \ Newtons. Using F=mg, we would predict that the force due to a 1kg</span> <span\
  \ m='575339'>mass would be 9.8Newtons. So the fact that we are measuring 9.9Newtons\
  \ indicates that</span> <span m='580760'>we have some experimental error in our\
  \ measurements. How would you use this setup to show whether</span> <span m='586990'>or\
  \ not forces add like vectors?</span> <span m='599910'>We want to see that the forces\
  \ sum to zero. To do this, let's decompose the forces into</span> <span m='604580'>horizontal\
  \ and vertical components. We use the fact that the string A is at a 135 degree</span>\
  \ <span m='611080'>angle. Because the magnitude of sin(135 )and cos(135) are both\
  \ one over square root of</span> <span m='616540'>2, we simply need to divide by\
  \ the square root of two. We find that the horizontal and</span> <span m='621390'>vertical\
  \ components of this tension force are approximately 4.9 Newtons. Because sin(45)</span>\
  \ <span m='627959'>and cos(45) are both one over the square root of two, we divide\
  \ by the square root of two</span> <span m='634269'>and find that each component\
  \ is approximately 5.1 N. Thus the horizontal forces subtract</span> <span m='643019'>to\
  \ give a net force of .2N in the positive x direction.</span> <span m='647640'>The\
  \ three vertical components add to 10-9.9 = .1 in the positive y direction. Because</span>\
  \ <span m='652240'>.1 and .2 are small, and because we know that there are errors\
  \ associated with the limits</span> <span m='658130'>of accuracy of out measurements,\
  \ we can be confident that these forces do, in fact, sum</span> <span m='663810'>to\
  \ 0.</span> <span m='664790'>So this demo does in fact suggest that forces add like\
  \ vectors. But we want to make sure</span> <span m='670260'>that this wasn't an\
  \ artifact of having so much symmetry in the system. To do this, we</span> <span\
  \ m='675110'>move string B 60 degrees off of horizontal.</span> <span m='680459'>As\
  \ you can see, the tension force on the bottom string did not change. It still reads\
  \ 9.6N.</span> <span m='686690'>But the force on each upper Newton scale has changed.\
  \ The tension force on String A is</span> <span m='692790'>5.5N, and the tension\
  \ force on the string B is 7.5N</span> <span m='698589'>We leave it as an exercise\
  \ to you to decompose the tension forces into horizontal and vertical</span> <span\
  \ m='705120'>components and verify that within the expected measurement error the\
  \ forces sum to zero.</span> <span m='719589'>Forces really do add like vectors!!</span>\
  \ <span m='722380'>Okay, so forces can indeed be represented with vectors. Let's\
  \ look back at the list</span> <span m='728040'>you generated of physical quantities\
  \ with both magnitude and direction. If force was</span> <span m='733000'>on your\
  \ list, we now know that force is indeed a vector quantity. Maybe you also listed\
  \ rotation.</span> <span m='740300'>Let's see if rotations have vector properties.\
  \ Rotation seems like a physical quantity that</span> <span m='745279'>has magnitude\
  \ and direction. The direction could be determined by the axis of rotation.</span>\
  \ <span m='751089'>We choose which way the arrow points based on the right hand\
  \ rule. The magnitude determines</span> <span m='756670'>how many radians through\
  \ which the object rotates. Consider the following two rotations:</span> <span m='763640'>Rz\
  \ rotates an object by 90 degrees about the z-axis: which rotates an object as such.\
  \ Ry</span> <span m='771940'>rotates an object by 90 degrees or \u03C0/2 radians\
  \ about the y-axis, which rotates the same object</span> <span m='779529'>in this\
  \ manner. Do rotations scale like vectors? Let's see what happens if we take the\
  \ vector</span> <span m='786750'>that represents a rotation of \u03C0/2 radians\
  \ about the z-axis and add it to itself -- it</span> <span m='793680'>seems that\
  \ it should be a rotation of \u03C0 radians, or 180 degrees. And this agrees with\
  \ what</span> <span m='801220'>we get by rotating 90 degrees about the z-axis twice.\
  \ So scaling rotations makes sense. Question:</span> <span m='809750'>Do rotations\
  \ add like vectors? If we rotate the object a quarter turn about the z-axis,</span>\
  \ <span m='821420'>followed by a quarter turn about the y-axis, the object ends\
  \ up in the following position.</span> <span m='827230'>If instead we rotate a quarter\
  \ of a turn about the y-axis, followed by a quarter turn about</span> <span m='832860'>the\
  \ z-axis, the object ends up in this position. Are the ending positions the same\
  \ for the</span> <span m='839950'>two different permutations of rotations? [Pause]\
  \ No, they are not. This means that rotations</span> <span m='846519'>don't add\
  \ commutatively, but vector addition must be commutative. So this tells us that</span>\
  \ <span m='852260'>we CANNOT use vectors to represent rotations. You'll learn that\
  \ it is better to use matrices</span> <span m='857709'>and matrix multiplication\
  \ to represent combinations of rotations. The tricky thing is that a vector</span>\
  \ <span m='863950'>can be used to represent the rotation rate, the time derivative\
  \ of rotation, quite well.</span> <span m='869670'>During this video, you came up\
  \ with several physical quantities that you theorized behave</span> <span m='875149'>like\
  \ vectors. Consider the following list of quantities. Compare our list to your own</span>\
  \ <span m='882170'>list, and determine whether each one is best represented by a\
  \ vector, a scalar, or neither.</span> <span m='888300'>You may need to design an\
  \ experiment or thought experiment in order to verify your hypothesis.</span> <span\
  \ m='895990'>To review, you have learned that:</span> <span m='899639'>Displacements\
  \ help guide our intuition for vector algebra.</span> <span m='903220'>Physical\
  \ quantities can be represented with vectors only when they have magnitude, have</span>\
  \ <span m='907130'>direction, scale, and add commutatively. Forces can be represented\
  \ by vectors, while</span> <span m='913050'>rotations cannot.</span> </p>"
