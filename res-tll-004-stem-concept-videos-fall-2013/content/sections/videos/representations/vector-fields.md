about_this_resource_text: <h2 class="subhead">Summary</h2><p>This video takes a look
  at a smoke probe visualization of airflow over a model of an F16 aircraft. The visualization
  is created in the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel. Two flow regimes are shown. The first
  is a low angle of attack visualization, where the flow field appears steady, or
  independent of time. The second flow regime has the model at a high angle of attack.
  In this case, the flow appears unsteady, which shows that the flow field has a time
  dependence. Prof. Dave Darmofal ends the demonstration by discussing how these visualizations
  are used in engineering.</p><h2 class="subhead">Learning Objectives</h2><p>After
  watching this video students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand that flow quantities
  around bodies are often analyzed in Eulerian frame.</li><li>Recognize that flow
  velocity is a vector field, which can be a function of space or a function of space
  and time.</li></ul><p>Funding provided by the Singapore University of Technology

transcript: '<p><span m=''3389''>This is an F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet. Look here.
  There are forward extensions of the</span> <span m=''9450''>wing called leading
  edge strakes or leading edge extensions. Why were the wings designed</span> <span
  m=''15020''>this way? In this video, you''ll find out.</span> </p><p><span m=''19250''>This
  video is part of the Representations video series. Information can be represented</span>
  <span m=''23810''>in words, through mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D
  models. Representations are used</span> <span m=''29859''>to develop a deeper and
  more flexible understanding of objects, systems, and processes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''35420''>Hi, I''m Dave Darmofal, and I''m a Professor in the Department of Aeronautics
  and Astronautics</span> <span m=''41210''>at MIT. In this video, we''re going to
  see an example that helps you to visualize the</span> <span m=''46690''>air velocity
  around an airplane body using smoke flow visualization. You will see that</span>
  <span m=''51539''>at low angles of attack, the velocity field is independent of
  time, while at high angles</span> <span m=''56829''>of attack the velocity field
  depends on space and time.</span> </p><p><span m=''61030''>After watching this video:
  * You will know that flow quantities around bodies are often</span> <span m=''65780''>analyzed
  using an Eulerian frame. * You will recognize that flow velocity is a vector field</span>
  <span m=''72130''>which depending on the application can be not only a function
  of space but also time.</span> </p><p><span m=''78500''>This is Dick, he''s the
  Senior Technical Instructor here in the department of Aeronautics and</span> <span
  m=''83670''>Astronautics. He is in charge of the Wright Brothers wind tunnel.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''87880''>* Wind tunnels are used to simulate the airflow around
  a variety of objects including buildings,</span> <span m=''92649''>cars, trains,
  and of course aircraft.</span> </p><p><span m=''96239''>* The Wright Brothers Wind
  Tunnel is an example of a closed-circuit wind tunnel, which uses</span> <span m=''100408''>a
  fan to circulate the air. The test section of the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel has
  an</span> <span m=''105610''>oval cross-section that is 7 feet high by 10 feet wide.
  The top velocities we typically</span> <span m=''112009''>use are around 100mph.
  While somewhat higher speeds are possible, the noise is increased</span> <span m=''117780''>rapidly
  with increased fan speed.</span> </p><p><span m=''126149''>* We will visualize the
  air velocity vector field using smoke visualization. We seed smoke</span> <span
  m=''131450''>in the tunnel through a handheld probe. The smoke follows the local
  air velocity allowing</span> <span m=''136950''>us to "see" where the flow is going.
  This smoke flow visualization techniques works</span> <span m=''142120''>best at
  lower wind speeds, so we will be testing at about 25 mph. In other words, the speed</span>
  <span m=''149480''>in the tunnel test section upstream of the model will be approximately
  25 mph.</span> </p><p><span m=''153719''>* The model we will be using is based on
  an F-16 aircraft. Several years ago, Lockheed</span> <span m=''157269''>Martin was
  investigating increasing the size of the F-16 wing. A key issue with the increased</span>
  <span m=''161230''>wing size, especially at the higher speeds the F-16 flies at,
  is the potential for aeroelastic</span> <span m=''168810''>instability due to coupling
  between the aerodynamic forces and the wing structure. In other words,</span> <span
  m=''173540''>because the wing is not a completely rigid structure, aerodynamic forces
  can cause the</span> <span m=''175760''>wing to vibrate, which can cause big problems
  during flight. To study this issue, Lockheed</span> <span m=''177090''>developed
  the following simplified geometry. In the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</span>
  <span m=''180120''>at MIT, we have also used this model for various labs and projects
  in our undergraduate subjects.</span> </p><p><span m=''180959''>* The model has
  three main parts to it:</span> <span m=''183450''>** The fuselage, which is a body
  of revolution with a pointed tip and a bluff end</span> <span m=''187510''>** The
  trapezoidal wing</span> <span m=''187620''>** Leading edge strakes, sometimes also
  called leading edge extensions</span> <span m=''190780''>* The leading edge strakes
  help stabilize the flow at high angles of attack by creating</span> <span m=''195030''>a
  strong vortex over the wing. This vortex is a region swirling velocity and low pressure</span>
  <span m=''198849''>and generates a significant amount of lift. Thus, strakes can
  provide significant performance</span> <span m=''207530''>benefits for aircraft
  that require high angle of attack maneuverability. We will look at</span> <span
  m=''215560''>the vortices created by these strakes today.</span> </p><p><span m=''221260''>In
  many aerodynamic applications, engineers analyze flows using an Eulerian frame in
  which</span> <span m=''227530''>flow quantities such as velocity, pressure, temperature,
  etc are viewed as fields: i.e.</span> </p><p><span m=''235170''>functions of space
  and often the space of interest is fixed to the objects frame of</span> <span m=''239930''>reference.
  In our case, this frame of reference is also the wind tunnels frame of reference.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''246019''>When you watch a river flowing downstream, an Eulerian
  view of the water flow is to watch</span> <span m=''250700''>the flow through a
  fixed point of space, as the water flows past you. For this demonstration,</span>
  <span m=''257360''>we will be visualizing the velocity which is not just a field,
  but in particular a vector</span> <span m=''262490''>field. Further, depending on
  the flow conditions, the velocity can be a function of time in</span> <span m=''268620''>addition
  to space. So, we''ll think of an air velocity vector field, v = v(x,t).</span> </p><p><span
  m=''275440''>* We will start by visualizing the flow at a low angle of attack that
  would be typical</span> <span m=''280850''>of a cruise condition, specifically we
  are at X degrees angle of attack. In particular,</span> <span m=''287380''>the flow
  at this low angle of attack is, to good approximation, "steady". This means that</span>
  <span m=''292700''>the flow quantities do not depend on time, though they do depend
  on space. In other words,</span> <span m=''298720''>the velocity field in this case
  is</span> <span m=''300570''>* I''ll begin by putting the smoke probe relatively
  high above the model. You can see the smoke</span> <span m=''310330''>travels in
  essentially a straight line downstream. Note that the line does not change in time</span>
  <span m=''315500''>indicating the flow is steady.</span> </p><p><span m=''317760''>*
  Now, I''ll move the probe slowly down toward the model. As I do, note that the smoke
  flow</span> <span m=''323960''>starts to show curvature, roughly pointing upwards
  in front of the model and then pointing</span> <span m=''329190''>downwards behind
  the model. This clearly shows that the direction of the velocity field changes</span>
  <span m=''334960''>depending on where we look. Further, note that the smoke lines
  are again steady. That</span> <span m=''342120''>is, when I hold the probe tip at
  a fixed location, the shape of the smoke line doesn''t change</span> <span m=''346930''>in
  time. Thus, we see that the air velocity for this condition is a "steady" or time-independent</span>
  <span m=''353370''>vector field, i.e. v = v(x).</span> </p><p><span m=''358700''>*
  Finally, let''s take a look at the flow that travels near the leading edge strakes
  to see</span> <span m=''363770''>if there is any evidence of a vortex. [Ad lib]</span>
  <span m=''374440''>UNSTEADY FLOW VISUALIZATION: TIME-DEPENDENT VECTOR FIELDS</span>
  <span m=''383740''>* Now, let''s increase the angle of attack to Y degrees. At this
  angle of attack, we</span> <span m=''390550''>will see that the smoke lines in some
  regions will no longer be fixed in time, even though</span> <span m=''395680''>the
  probe location is fixed. This indicates that the velocity vector field is time-dependent,</span>
  <span m=''402350''>i.e.</span> </p><p><span m=''404090''>* We''ll start by placing
  the probe again relatively high above the model. We again see straight</span> <span
  m=''411360''>and steady smoke line.</span> </p><p><span m=''413290''>* As we again
  move the probe slowly toward the body, we again see the curvature of the</span>
  <span m=''417400''>smoke lines. Relative to the low angle of attack case, note that
  the curvature has increased.</span> </p><p><span m=''424330''>The smoke is still
  steady as we approach the body, however, ...</span> </p><p><span m=''428300''>*
  When we start to get much closer to the body, we start to see that the smoke lines</span>
  <span m=''433080''>change in time. In fact, they change so rapidly that the smoke
  tends to "mix out". Clearly,</span> <span m=''440190''>v = v(x,t)</span> <span m=''442000''>*
  Let''s look at the flow by the leading edge strake. Now we can see the vortex, which
  is</span> <span m=''451020''>characterized by the swirling or corkscrew-like behavior
  of the smoke line. Also note that</span> <span m=''464120''>the smoke line is changing
  shape with time, again indicating that v = v(x,t)</span> <span m=''473050''>Flow
  visualization is used to help engineers understand what is happening in a flow.
  Usually,</span> <span m=''479190''>flow visualization is combined with other measurements
  such as force and moment measurements</span> <span m=''483710''>on the body to arrive
  at a more complete picture. In the high angle of attack condition we just</span>
  <span m=''489000''>explored, a key question is when the strake vortex becomes unsteady,
  where is the unsteadiness?</span> </p><p><span m=''496860''>For example, is it over
  the fuselage, over the wing, etc? This is important because the</span> <span m=''503670''>unsteady
  velocity is usually tied to unsteady pressures acting on the aircraft, which can</span>
  <span m=''509280''>then drive the aeroelastic instability and lead to decreased
  life of parts of the aircraft.</span> </p><p><span m=''515909''>An example of this
  actually happened to the F-18 in which the tail of the aircraft was</span> <span
  m=''520520''>subject to unsteady forces caused by fluctuations in the strake vortex.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''526150''>This caused the first F-18''s to be limited to only a
  few hundred flight hours as opposed</span> <span m=''531300''>to the thousands of
  flight hours the Navy desired. A flow visualization of the F-18</span> <span m=''537030''>strake
  vortex is shown here.</span> </p><p><span m=''542080''>Here''s a quick summary of
  what we saw in this demonstration:</span> <span m=''545640''>* Flow quantities around
  bodies are often analyzed using an Euler frame.</span> </p><p><span m=''550660''>*
  The flow velocity is a vector field which depending on the application can be not
  only</span> <span m=''555930''>a function of space but also time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''559200''>* For the aircraft model, we saw that at low angles of attack, the
  velocity vector field</span> <span m=''564410''>was steady (though did depend on
  space). At high angles of attack, the velocity field</span> <span m=''570990''>was
  unsteady, i.e. depending on space AND time.</span> </p>'
