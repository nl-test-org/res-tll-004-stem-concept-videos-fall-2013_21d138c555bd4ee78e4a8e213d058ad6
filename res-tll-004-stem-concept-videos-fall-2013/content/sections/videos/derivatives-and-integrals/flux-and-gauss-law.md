title: Flux and Gauss' Law
transcript: '<p><span m=''3350''>What do rain, bees, and vectors have in common? They''re
  all ways that MIT physicists visualize</span> <span m=''10600''>the concept of "flux."
  In this video, we''ll explore flux as it relates to Gauss'' law.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''16160''>If you''ve ever had trouble choosing the right Gaussian surface, getting
  a quantity out of</span> <span m=''20480''>an integral, or just wanted to know what
  flux is, get ready: this video is for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''25970''>This
  video is part of the Derivatives and Integrals video series.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''29330''>Derivatives and integrals are used to analyze the properties of a system.
  Derivatives describe</span> <span m=''34190''>local properties of systems, and integrals
  quantify their cumulative properties.</span> </p><p><span m=''38999''>"Hello. My
  name is Peter Fisher. I am a professor in the physics department at MIT, and today</span>
  <span m=''44249''>I''ll be talking with you about electric flux and Gauss'' Law.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''48239''>By this time in your course you''ve seen and used Gauss''
  Law quite a bit. You have a good</span> <span m=''53149''>handle on the electric
  field, what it does and how it works. We will also assume that</span> <span m=''57899''>you
  know how to take an area integral, a skill that is important to Gauss'' Law but
  which</span> <span m=''62559''>is not taught in this video.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''64510''>Our end goal is to improve your ability to use Gauss'' Law. To do this,
  we''ll help you</span> <span m=''69180''>develop an organized view of electric flux
  and what goes into it. We''ll also spend a</span> <span m=''74030''>lot of time
  talking about symmetry and how to use it to your advantage.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''79549''>We''re going to start by thinking about what goes into flux and the
  interrelationships</span> <span m=''84020''>between these quantities, so that we
  can use flux more effectively.</span> </p><p><span m=''89049''>As a refresher, here
  are the two equations we''ll be working with today: the definition</span> <span
  m=''93509''>of flux and Gauss'' Law. You may have seen these written with a double
  integral, or with</span> <span m=''98729''>slightly different notation, so take
  a quick look to make sure you''re familiar with all</span> <span m=''103320''>the
  pieces.</span> </p><p><span m=''106770''>To really use symmetry to our best advantage
  in Gauss'' Law, we need to understand a few</span> <span m=''111609''>more basic
  things. We need to be able to use vector areas, to categorize charge distributions,</span>
  <span m=''117810''>and to determine when and how the two can work together.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''122109''>The underlying reason we want to use symmetry is that
  integrals are difficult, significantly</span> <span m=''127359''>more difficult
  than derivatives. There are many situations in which we cannot determine</span>
  <span m=''132050''>the flux integral. Therefore, we seek to simplify.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''137140''>The integrals we''re dealing with are surface integrals, also called
  area integrals. There</span> <span m=''141450''>are two basic kinds, open and closed,
  as you can see on the screen. An open surface uses</span> <span m=''146970''>an
  open integral, and a closed surface uses a closed integral. Flux can be defined
  for</span> <span m=''152440''>any surface, but Gauss'' Law uses only closed integrals.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''157000''>When we take the integral, we use dA, a tiny piece of
  the area. dA is a vector piece of</span> <span m=''163220''>the area, so it has
  a direction to it as well. dA always points perpendicular to the surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''169500''>With closed surfaces we usually choose dA to point outward
  from the surface.</span> </p><p><span m=''174740''>dA usually gets represented as
  two other differentials, such as dx times dy. Which two depends on</span> <span
  m=''182060''>the coordinate system you choose, with some being more complex than
  others. Sometimes</span> <span m=''187840''>we will need these, so it''s good to
  have them. The good part is that if we use symmetry correctly,</span> <span m=''194120''>we
  can avoid having to do an integral at all.</span> </p><p><span m=''198970''>Let''s
  pursue our goal of not doing an integral. We have this integral of E dot dA. Let''s
  write</span> <span m=''205090''>the dot product as a cosine. Under certain circumstances,
  we can remove the E from the</span> <span m=''210470''>integral. We can only do
  that when our electric field has uniform magnitude over the entire</span> <span
  m=''216200''>surface. You can see some examples on the bottom of the screen.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''223000''>We can remove the cosine(theta) from our integral only
  when the angle between the area and the</span> <span m=''228230''>electric field
  doesn''t change. The left-hand example shows a field that always points in</span>
  <span m=''233340''>the same direction, and an area that always points in the same
  direction. The middle example</span> <span m=''238829''>has a field whose direction
  changes, but it always points outward, just like the area</span> <span m=''243800''>vector
  from the cylinder points outward. It still works. In the right-hand example, the</span>
  <span m=''250390''>field has a constant direction, but the area vector does not.
  The angle between them changes,</span> <span m=''255800''>so we couldn''t remove
  the cosine from the integral.</span> </p><p><span m=''259370''>If we want to move
  both the field and the cosine out of the integral, we need to fulfill</span> <span
  m=''266350''>both conditions. The left-hand and center examples only fill one condition
  each. The</span> <span m=''272470''>example on the right has both, and would be
  ideal to use.</span> </p><p><span m=''278500''>Before we move on, a reminder about
  flux and angles. Only electric field lines that actually</span> <span m=''283930''>pass
  through a surface provide flux. When the surface is parallel to the field, no flux</span>
  <span m=''289010''>is provided. This is particularly useful for some three-dimensional
  surfaces, such as the</span> <span m=''294080''>empty cylinder to the right. If
  we remember this, we can really simplify our integrals.</span> </p><p><span m=''298730''>Another
  thing to remember: Flux is a scalar. As long as the field strength is the same,</span>
  <span m=''299690''>and the angle between the field and surface stays the same, the
  flux will be the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''300660''>We don''t have to worry
  about the flux pointing in a particular direction, because it''s just</span> <span
  m=''301560''>a number with no direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''301840''>Now we
  know how we would like the field and the area to line up. Next we need to understand</span>
  <span m=''306720''>the circumstances that make that possible. We need to look at
  electric charge distributions</span> <span m=''311680''>and their symmetry.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''313400''>Electric charge can come as a single point, as in an electron
  or proton, but it can also</span> <span m=''319070''>take other shapes. It might
  be stretched into a line, spread throughout a volume, or spread</span> <span m=''324040''>over
  a surface. Not a Gaussian surface - remember, that''s something we make up to solve
  a problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''330480''>Charge is spread on a physical object.
  You can stretch the charge out into lines, spread</span> <span m=''335490''>it on
  thick wires or spherical shells, build a solid ball out of it, or even just smear</span>
  <span m=''340970''>it around on an object.</span> </p><p><span m=''343220''>An object
  has symmetry when it has exactly similar parts that are either facing each</span>
  <span m=''347800''>other, or arranged around an axis. On the screen are some pictures
  of objects that have</span> <span m=''353290''>symmetry.</span> </p><p><span m=''354510''>There
  are three categories that we''ll investigate, and three types of symmetry to consider.
  Our</span> <span m=''361310''>hope is to have a highly symmetric charge distribution,
  with any of the three types</span> <span m=''365460''>of symmetry. That''s when
  Gauss'' Law is easiest to apply.</span> </p><p><span m=''369389''>These examples
  have little or no symmetry to them, and are not the sort of thing for</span> <span
  m=''373490''>which we can use Gauss'' Law.</span> </p><p><span m=''376280''>These
  three charge distributions have visible symmetry, but it''s not enough. We need
  a charge</span> <span m=''381330''>distribution so symmetric that the field it generates
  is also symmetric.</span> </p><p><span m=''386580''>Let us show why. Let''s say
  we have a charged cube, which is certainly a symmetric object.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''392290''>We can draw the field from it fairly easily. If we place a cubical
  Gaussian surface around</span> <span m=''397669''>the charge, we can see the problem:
  the field and the surface have different angles in different</span> <span m=''403310''>places.
  There''s some symmetry here, but not enough to allow us to pull everything out</span>
  <span m=''408139''>of the integral.</span> </p><p><span m=''410870''>These cases
  are ideal: a point charge, a spherical shell, an infinite sheet of charge, or an</span>
  <span m=''417639''>infinite cylindrical shell of charge. No doubt you''ve used Gauss''
  Law with these charge distributions</span> <span m=''423419''>before. How can we
  describe such distributions and find others like them?</span> </p><p><span m=''429639''>All
  three of those have a special quality: if you move in two directions, they look
  exactly</span> <span m=''434630''>the same. No matter how far you move across the
  plane in the x or y directions, it looks</span> <span m=''440510''>identical. Move
  along the cylinder or around it, and it looks the same. Rotate around the</span>
  <span m=''446699''>sphere around the equator or the poles, and you can''t tell the
  difference.</span> </p><p><span m=''451990''>We can also add similar objects together
  or scale them however we like. By integrating</span> <span m=''457580''>the fields
  from a lot of shells, we can create a solid object, just like these Russian nesting</span>
  <span m=''463199''>dolls.</span> </p><p><span m=''464400''>Of course, perfectly
  symmetric charge distributions are rare in real life. This is probably because</span>
  <span m=''470210''>infinitely long cylinders are so hard to find. Thus we often
  use Gauss'' Law in cases where</span> <span m=''476510''>the charge distributions
  are close to one of our symmetric cases. We can usually obtain</span> <span m=''482040''>excellent
  estimates of the true electric field in this way.</span> </p><p><span m=''485800''>Two
  approximations are particularly common: when the object is so large that we can
  treat</span> <span m=''490699''>it as being infinite, or when we are so close to
  the object that its large-scale features</span> <span m=''496430''>become unimportant.
  In these cases, we often treat the object as being an infinite plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''503150''>Here''s an example of the first approximation. Compare the distance
  from your point of interest</span> <span m=''508370''>to the object, to the size
  of the object itself. If the smallest dimension of the object is</span> <span m=''514250''>ten
  times your distance from it, you can rely on a very good estimation from Gauss''
  Law,</span> <span m=''519999''>even if your plane isn''t really infinite.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''522938''>To use the other approximation, we want a situation where
  the curvature is very small</span> <span m=''528089''>in the place we care about.
  For example, it would be very difficult for us to find the</span> <span m=''532709''>field
  at this point. However, if we zoom in, we can reach a point where the surface looks</span>
  <span m=''538699''>like a flat plane. Finding an estimate for the field at this
  point will be much easier.</span> </p><p><span m=''546589''>Now we have the background
  we need. It''s time to put all the pieces together and pick our</span> <span m=''551290''>Gaussian
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m=''552699''>We''ll do a quick review in case you missed
  something, and give you an example or two.</span> </p><p><span m=''558249''>After
  that, it''s your turn to pick the best surface for a given situation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''563430''>In order to simplify our integrals as much as possible, we seek out
  situations with as</span> <span m=''568350''>much symmetry as we can get. The symmetry
  in the charge distribution isn''t something</span> <span m=''573110''>we can control,
  but our choice of surface will determine whether there is symmetry in</span> <span
  m=''578439''>how the electric field meets the Gaussian surface. And that''s always
  the key: you choose</span> <span m=''583410''>the surface to make the problem easier
  for you. Finally, it''s important to remember that</span> <span m=''587980''>in
  some cases, Gauss'' Law won''t be helpful, and it''s good to look for another method.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''593480''>Here are three charge distributions: a long cylinder,
  a sphere, and a flat plane. To maximize</span> <span m=''600699''>the effects of
  symmetry, we choose surfaces that match up well with the charge distributions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''606499''>To find the field near a cylinder, we surround it with
  another cylinder. To find the field</span> <span m=''611629''>near a sphere, we
  encase it in a sphere. To find the field near a charged plane, we use</span> <span
  m=''617619''>a box-shaped surface. Sometimes people will use a cylindrical surface
  instead, and count</span> <span m=''622949''>the flux that goes through the top
  of the cylinder. Both approaches are valid.</span> </p><p><span m=''629100''>Here
  is your first challenge: choose the Gaussian surface that will best fit this charge
  distribution.</span> </p><p><span m=''635490''>We want to know the electric field
  at a certain distance from the center of this solid sphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''641879''>What surface would you choose?</span> </p><p><span m=''646220''>A sphere
  inside our existing sphere will be easiest. This example helps us remember that</span>
  <span m=''654920''>the Gaussian surface can be inside an object. The area of the
  surface will be the usual</span> <span m=''659170''>four thirds pi r cubed. We''ll
  need to remember to use only the charge inside our volume,</span> <span m=''663379''>not
  the whole charge of the sphere.</span> </p><p><span m=''667980''>Here''s challenge
  number two. We would like to know the electric charge contained in a</span> <span
  m=''673240''>thundercloud. Let''s say that the inside of the cloud has an electric
  field that looks</span> <span m=''677059''>like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''678860''>What
  surface would you choose?</span> </p><p><span m=''687689''>A box-shaped surface
  will take advantage of the Cartesian symmetry in this electric field.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''693829''>Because of the alignment between the sides of the box and the electric
  field, they will</span> <span m=''697959''>not contribute to the flux integral.
  We can use just the area of the top and bottom of</span> <span m=''703139''>the
  box, and the field at those locations, to find the flux. This is a common technique.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''711249''>Here''s challenge number three: finding the electric field
  at a certain distance from</span> <span m=''715540''>the center of charged disc.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''718869''>What surface would you choose?</span> </p><p><span m=''726959''>No
  surface will work! The problem is that there''s not enough symmetry in this situation</span>
  <span m=''731600''>to pick an appropriate surface.</span> </p><p><span m=''733959''>If
  we can''t get an exact solution, we would like to approximate the field. Unfortunately,</span>
  <span m=''739739''>if we look at the distances involved, we are not close enough
  to the disc to make a good</span> <span m=''744199''>approximation.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''745730''>In the end, this is not a good Gauss'' Law problem. It is solved much
  more easily through</span> <span m=''750899''>other techniques, such as integration
  and Coulomb''s Law. An example can be found in</span> <span m=''755929''>the supplemental
  materials for this video.</span> </p><p><span m=''759319''>Here is the final challenge.
  A top and side view of the field are shown.</span> </p><p><span m=''764300''>What
  surface would align well with this field?</span> </p><p><span m=''772589''>A cylindrical
  surface would work very well with this circular field. You can see that</span> <span
  m=''777769''>the field is perpendicular to the area vector at all points. Our dot
  product is now giving</span> <span m=''783350''>us a cosine of ninety degrees at
  all times. This means a zero value for the flux at all</span> <span m=''789569''>points.
  We don''t even need to determine the area of the cylinder.</span> </p><p><span m=''794589''>If
  our flux is zero, the total charge inside must also be zero. We might guess that
  positive</span> <span m=''800559''>and negative charges together could create this
  field, but as it turns out, they cannot.</span> </p><p><span m=''806149''>Fields
  that look like this are created by a changing magnetic field, using Faraday''s</span>
  <span m=''810529''>Law, which you will learn more about later in your course.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''814559''>There are some times when you''ll just have to integrate;
  there''s no way around it. Not</span> <span m=''818749''>every situation is perfectly
  symmetric. When you come to these situations, look for the</span> <span m=''824139''>following
  things to help you out. First, an area vector that you can define easily. Second,</span>
  <span m=''830649''>an electric field that you can easily find or that is defined
  for you in a problem. Third,</span> <span m=''836959''>see if you can create a surface
  where either the magnitude of the field or its angle is</span> <span m=''841730''>uniform.
  The more of these you can take advantage of, the better.</span> </p><p><span m=''847809''>Let''s
  review.</span> </p><p><span m=''848939''>The more symmetry we can take advantage
  of in our problem, the easier time we''ll have</span> <span m=''853519''>with Gauss''
  Law and flux. Ideally, we want a situation where the charge, the field it</span>
  <span m=''860209''>creates, and the Gaussian surface we choose all have the same
  symmetry, so that we can</span> <span m=''865049''>simplify the integral as much
  as possible.</span> </p><p><span m=''869600''>For the final segment of this video,
