transcript: '<p><span m=''4310''>Lot''s of things in our lives transmit signals. From
  your cell phone when it''s making a call,</span> <span m=''9610''>to your computer
  when it''s sending an email, to your local radio station when it''s broadcasting.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''15660''>Here you see two objects that receive signals - they are
  radio receivers. Have you ever</span> <span m=''20369''>wondered how they pick out
  the signal they want out of all of the radio waves around</span> <span m=''24580''>them?
  In this video, we''re going to find out.</span> </p><p><span m=''29029''>This video
  is part of the information flow video series. A system is shaped and changed</span>
  <span m=''35180''>by the nature and flow of information into, within, and out of
  the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''40310''>Hi, my name is Elena Glassman, and I
  am a graduate student in the Electrical Engineering</span> <span m=''45360''>and
  Computer Science Department at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m=''49440''>Before watching
  this video, you should be familiar with basic electrical circuits, and</span> <span
  m=''54490''>how inductors, capacitors, and AM radio transmitters work.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''59540''>After watching this video, you will be able to explain how a basic radio
  receiver circuit</span> <span m=''63770''>functions to select particular radio frequencies.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''73049''>This Hammarlund HQ120 communications receiver was introduced
  in 1938. It tunes in radio</span> <span m=''79049''>waves ranging from 540 thousand
  cycles per second to 30 million cycles per second. It</span> <span m=''85590''>can
  decode signals encoded with Amplitude Modulation, abbreviated as AM, or "continuous</span>
  <span m=''91439''>wave" modulation, abbreviated as CW.</span> </p><p><span m=''95408''>This
  Drake R-4 was introduced later, in 1964, and is optimized for amateur radio bands
  within</span> <span m=''101749''>the same frequency range covered by the HQ120.
  Both of these radios were popular with amateur</span> <span m=''107819''>radio operators.
  Amateur radio operators are radio enthusiasts</span> <span m=''112530''>who pass
  U.S. Federal Communications Commission tests to receive official government call</span>
  <span m=''117399''>signs and the right to broadcast on select bands.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''121170''>Amateur radio operators are anything but amateur, serving as part of
  an important worldwide</span> <span m=''126009''>network. When cell phones, the
  internet, or other communication networks are down, amateur</span> <span m=''131890''>radio
  operators can help pass along important information. Amateur radio operators have</span>
  <span m=''137810''>historically experimented with and advanced cutting-edge radio
  technologies. (viewers</span> <span m=''142650''>hear radio making some noise)</span>
  <span m=''145640''>Let''s delve deeper into how these radios receive information.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''150099''>Recall that radio waves are electromagnetic waves whose
  frequencies fall in a certain</span> <span m=''155599''>range. A variety of data
  types can be transmitted over radio waves by systematically modulating</span> <span
  m=''162500''>some property of the wave.</span> </p><p><span m=''164730''>The information
  we want to transmit--say speech or music--has a much lower frequency than</span>
  <span m=''170739''>the carrier radio wave. We can encode this lower frequency by
  modulating the amplitude</span> <span m=''176709''>of the carrier wave. This is
  called Amplitude Modulation, which is used in AM radio.</span> </p><p><span m=''183140''>CW
  radio stands for continuous wave modulation and is traditionally used to transmit
  Morse</span> <span m=''189629''>code by switching the carrier signal on and off.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''192870''>All of the signals being transmitted around the globe
  are superimposed on to each other.</span> </p><p><span m=''200360''>Our goal is
  to understand how a basic radio circuit, called the regenerative circuit,</span>
  <span m=''206299''>works to pick out one frequency. This circuit was a breakthrough
  in radio technology both</span> <span m=''212150''>in terms of amplification and
  selectivity.</span> </p><p><span m=''215930''>It was invented in 1914 by American
  electrical engineer Edwin Armstrong when he was an undergraduate</span> <span m=''222329''>at
  Columbia University.</span> </p><p><span m=''224700''>This circuit was widely used
  in radio receivers, called regenerative receivers, between 1920</span> <span m=''231379''>and
  World War II. They are still used in low-cost electronic equipment such as garage
  door openers.</span> </p><p><span m=''238890''>Our Hammerlund and Drake radios use
  more sophisticated circuitry, also invented by Armstrong. However,</span> <span
  m=''245890''>we''re going focus on the more basic and still powerful regenerative
  circuit.</span> </p><p><span m=''255939''>The regenerative circuit seen here is
  a classical, elegant electrical circuit that amplifies</span> <span m=''263229''>while
  selecting a particular radio wave frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''267250''>Let''s
  start by identifying the elements from this diagram in our actual radio. This is</span>
  <span m=''273800''>the antenna for the radio. And this is the symbol for that antenna
  in</span> <span m=''278340''>our diagram. This dial allows us to control the frequency</span>
  <span m=''283220''>we''re selecting. And this is the variable capacitance element
  that determines which</span> <span m=''288470''>frequency this basic regenerative
  receiver circuit will select for.</span> </p><p><span m=''293000''>This is a vacuum
  tube in the radio.</span> </p><p><span m=''295490''>And in the diagram. It is going
  to act as an amplifier.</span> </p><p><span m=''301680''>Together the volume control
  and the speaker enable us to hear the information decoded</span> <span m=''306400''>from
  the radio signal.</span> </p><p><span m=''308360''>These are represented by a variable
  resistor and the headphone cartoon in our diagram.</span> </p><p><span m=''314020''>Now
  let''s understand how this circuit works! Radio waves induce waves of alternating
  current</span> <span m=''319569''>through the antenna. By the phenomenon of inductive
  coupling, the radio wave energy</span> <span m=''324720''>is picked up by this tuned
  circuit, which is just an inductor and variable capacitor</span> <span m=''330300''>in
  parallel. This circuit acts like an echo chamber for radio waves.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''336300''>To get a better sense of how this parallel inductor and capacitor work,
  let''s look at</span> <span m=''341110''>a system with which you may be more familiar--brass
  instruments.</span> </p><p><span m=''344580''>Brass players create lots of sound
  frequencies when they blow through their mouthpieces.</span> </p><p><span m=''350500''>[sound
  of buzzing] The brass tube acts as a resonant cavity or</span> <span m=''354729''>echo
  chamber. Sound waves bounce back and forth between each end of the tube.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''361139''>Particular frequencies constructively interfere or reinforce
  each other, while other frequencies</span> <span m=''366099''>destructively interfere,
  and therefore have their amplitude diminished.</span> </p><p><span m=''371370''>As
  the slide is moved, the length of the tube changes, and that changes which frequencies</span>
  <span m=''377259''>are reinforced and which frequencies are damped. This parallel
  inductor and capacitor act the</span> <span m=''383680''>same way for radio waves.
  Changing the capacitance of the capacitor is equivalent to changing</span> <span
  m=''390780''>the length of the trombone''s tube by moving the slide.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''394430''>The noise produced by buzzing into the mouthpiece and filtering it
  with the brass tube is sufficient</span> <span m=''400050''>to produce audible sound.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''402199''>But radio waves may be coming from transmitters very far
  away, and may have very small amplitudes</span> <span m=''408990''>by the time they
  reach us. It''s not uncommon for these receivers to pick up radio stations</span>
  <span m=''415909''>part way around the globe. How are we going to deal with this?
  We need amplification!</span> </p><p><span m=''422810''>The radio waves echoing
  in the tuned circuit here are applied to the input of this vacuum</span> <span m=''428099''>tube,
  which acts as an amplifier. An amplifier reproduces the signal applied to its input,</span>
  <span m=''434810''>but with greater magnitude. The added energy comes from a local
  power source, like a battery.</span> </p><p><span m=''441639''>That might be enough
  amplification, but we can do even better using positive feedback!</span> </p><p><span
  m=''446409''>The tickler, located here, takes the amplified radio signal from the
  vacuum tube and feeds</span> <span m=''454110''>it back into the echo chamber, to
  reinforce new radio waves coming in from the antenna</span> <span m=''460009''>at
  that same frequency!</span> </p><p><span m=''462050''>A frequency is strengthened
  by the echo chamber alone, so it becomes even larger in amplitude</span> <span m=''468229''>after
  amplification and positive feedback into the same echo chamber! Likewise, any</span>
  <span m=''474569''>frequencies that did not resonate well in the echo chamber will
  be diminished further</span> <span m=''479889''>with each circulation back through
  the loop. This echo chamber with its output amplified</span> <span m=''486590''>and
  fed back into itself is what is responsible for achieving our stated goal of selecting</span>
  <span m=''492800''>only one frequency to tune in to, in the presence of all the
  other frequencies carrying information.</span> </p><p><span m=''500289''>Now that
  we have selected and amplified the carrier frequency, we still need to extract</span>
  <span m=''505590''>the original information.</span> </p><p><span m=''511129''>You
  might expect our signal after amplification to look like this. But the information
  encoded</span> <span m=''517940''>in the amplitude would be hard to decode because
  the average amplitude is constant everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m=''525010''>Luckily
  for us, the vacuum tube is a nonlinear amplifier.</span> </p><p><span m=''530860''>It
  accentuates the lower half of the signal and diminishes the top half, giving us
  a signal</span> <span m=''537760''>that looks more like this. Since headphones are
  natural smoothing filters</span> <span m=''545350''>that convert variations in current
  to air pressure waves, the user hears the original</span> <span m=''551510''>information
  encoded in the AM signal. If we hadn''t accentuated the lower half of the signal</span>
  <span m=''558700''>before smoothing, you wouldn''t hear anything. There''s one last
  aspect of this simple regenerative</span> <span m=''561149''>receiver we''d like
  to point out.</span> </p><p><span m=''561250''>After all this selective amplification
  of the carrier frequency, we must still extract</span> <span m=''561480''>the information
  carried by the envelope of its amplitude.</span> </p><p><span m=''561630''>We take
  advantage of the imperfect amplification of the vacuum tube to accentuate the lower</span>
  <span m=''561890''>half of the signal.</span> </p><p><span m=''561959''>Since headphones
  are natural smoothing filters that convert variations in current to air</span> <span
  m=''562180''>pressure waves, the user hears the original information encoded in
  the AM signal.</span> </p><p><span m=''562410''>It was extremely clever to use a
  single tube to amplify, provide selectivity, and demodulate</span> <span m=''570760''>an
  AM signal at a time when tubes were very expensive and considered cutting edge.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''577470''>This Drake R-4 radio uses more sophisticated circuitry
  but even modern radio receivers</span> <span m=''583120''>are built with digital
  circuits that operate on the same basic principles!</span> </p><p><span m=''594180''>Radio
  is a cool, handy way to disseminate information, so humans have created lots and</span>
  <span m=''600800''>lots of electromagnetic waves and transmitted them into the air
  at various frequencies.</span> </p><p><span m=''607290''>We''ve even standardized
  who can transmit and at what frequency.</span> </p><p><span m=''611320''>Here''s
  the radio spectrum that is available. You see AM and FM broadcast within this spectrum.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''619120''>This radio spectrum has been divided up even further for
  different uses: mobile phones,</span> <span m=''625779''>amateur astronomy, satellites,
  space research, amateur radio, and Earth research.</span> </p><p><span m=''631750''>Zooming
  out further we see that lots of different communities have their own spot allocated.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''638060''>Out of all of that radio activity, we can now pull out
  what we personally want. Maybe</span> <span m=''643470''>it''s finding a friend
  or fellow amateur radio operator transmitting from another continent,</span> <span
  m=''649220''>or maybe it''s the BBC, broadcasting international news.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''658339''>To summarize, in this video, we have explained how the components in
  the regenerative receiver</span> <span m=''664970''>circuit work together to dampen
  unwanted frequencies, while selectively amplifying and demodulating</span> <span
  m=''672540''>a desired AM signal. This is no small feat, given the amount of radio
  waves humans broadcast!</span> </p><p><span m=''679990''>We''ve also demonstrated
  the tuning process with a Drake R-4 radio receiver built for</span> <span m=''685660''>amateur
  radio operators in the 1960s. Learning about these radio receivers with my dad when</span>
  <span m=''692459''>I was a kid was instrumental in developing my own interest in
  electrical engineering!</span> </p><p><span m=''698649''>It was really fun to share
  some of the circuitry with you. If you want to try something a little</span> <span
  m=''703160''>more hands-on, I recommend checking out the local amateur radio community
  or signing up</span> <span m=''709320''>for a course in electrical engineering!</span>
