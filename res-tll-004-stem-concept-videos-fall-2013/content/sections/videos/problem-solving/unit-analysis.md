title: Unit Analysis
transcript: "<p><span m='3250'> In December 1998, the Mars climate orbiter was launched\
  \ in hopes of providing detailed</span> <span m='8490'>information about the atmosphere\
  \ of Mars. The launch went well. However the two teams</span> <span m='13330'>that\
  \ collaborated on the project worked in different units--one used the metric system,</span>\
  \ <span m='18240'>and the other the English system, and the two systems of units\
  \ were never properly reconciled.</span> <span m='23300'>So while the orbiter was\
  \ intended to fall into orbit around Mars, instead it crash landed</span> <span\
  \ m='28269'>on the surface. So units are pretty important.</span> <span m='33570'>This\
  \ video is part of the Problem Solving video series. Problem-solving skills, in\
  \ combination</span> <span m='38440'>with an understanding of the natural and human-made\
  \ world, are critical to the design and optimization</span> <span m='43800'>of systems\
  \ and processes.</span> <span m='47010'>Hi my name is Ken Kamrin, and I am a mechanical\
  \ engineering professor at MIT. Today I want</span> <span m='52300'>to talk to you\
  \ about using unit analysis in problem solving. This might seem simple, but</span>\
  \ <span m='59039'>it is a critical tool for validating your calculations. So pay\
  \ attention.</span> <span m='62239'>To understand this example, you should be familiar\
  \ with the definition of work.</span> <span m='67020'>After watching this video,\
  \ you should be able to</span> <span m='69150'>utilize and apply the key properties\
  \ of unit analysis:</span> <span m='72920'>when two quantities are multiplied, their\
  \ units also multiply.</span> <span m='76470'>all terms added, subtracted or equated\
  \ must have the same units.</span> <span m='80640'>You should also be able to explain\
  \ how derivatives and integrals affect units.</span> <span m='85420'>Before we start\
  \ the main example, let's discuss how integration and differentiation affect</span>\
  \ <span m='89990'>units. The first question is: what are the units of dx? You should\
  \ think of dx as a very</span> <span m='99350'>small change in x or a \"little bit\
  \ of x\", Recall that a little bit of ice cream, is</span> <span m='105259'>still\
  \ ice cream. Even if it is a very very small amount. So the units of dx are precisely</span>\
  \ <span m='119520'>the units of x. Let's do an example. Let's consider the position\
  \ function x(t) with units</span> <span m='129780'>of meters, where t is time, with\
  \ units of seconds. Then velocity is the time derivative</span> <span m='137890'>of\
  \ position v = dx/dt, and has units of meters per second. Let's look at how the\
  \ notation</span> <span m='144489'>is consistent with our physical interpretation:\
  \ dx has units of meters, and it is divided</span> <span m='150980'>by dt, which\
  \ has units of seconds. So dx over dt should have units of meters over seconds.</span>\
  \ <span m='160780'>Now let's look at acceleration, which has units of meters per\
  \ second squared. We know</span> <span m='166560'>that acceleration is the time\
  \ derivative</span> <span m='181290'>of velocity, which is the second derivative\
  \ of position with respect to time. Let's see</span> <span m='211280'>how this plays\
  \ out with notation... We can also determine how integration affects units.</span>\
  \ <span m='221489'>Let's use the example of the integral of velocity v with respect\
  \ to time t. We know physically</span> <span m='228930'>that this is position, which\
  \ has units of meters. Unit analysis also makes this clear</span> <span m='234799'>because\
  \ v has units of m/s, and dt has units of s, so when we multiply, the seconds cancel,</span>\
  \ <span m='242840'>and we end up with units of seconds It might be interesting to\
  \ point out that the integral</span> <span m='247909'>symbol doesn't affect units\
  \ at all. Just like the differential did not have units, it is</span> <span m='254629'>just\
  \ a symbol that represents the limit of sums. Since every term in the sum has units</span>\
  \ <span m='261160'>of v times units of t, the sums, hence the integral sign doesn't\
  \ affect units at all.</span> <span m='267460'>What we've seen: given a function\
  \ f(y), differentiating with respect to y divides the units of f by</span> <span\
  \ m='276310'>the units of y. Differentiating twice divides the units of f by the\
  \ units of y squared.</span> <span m='285470'>Similarly, integrating with respect\
  \ to y multiplies the units off by the units of y</span> <span m='292800'>In this\
  \ example, we'll see how unit analysis can help us check our calculation of the\
  \ work</span> <span m='297659'>done by an applied force. A machine in a factory\
  \ is programmed to apply a force to a 3.0kg</span> <span m='305720'>object to move\
  \ it back and forth in the horizontal direction. The position of the object as a</span>\
  \ <span m='311970'>function of time is given by the equation x equals 3.0t minus\
  \ 4.0 t squared plus 1.0</span> <span m='319930'>t cubed, where x is measured in\
  \ units of meters, and t in seconds. Find the work done on the</span> <span m='325680'>object\
  \ by the force from t=0 to t=2. Note that work is done when a force is applied</span>\
  \ <span m='334419'>over a distance on an object. Let x0 be the position of the object\
  \ at time t = 0. Let</span> <span m='342419'>x2 be the position at time t = 2. Then\
  \ the amount of work done on the object is computed</span> <span m='349990'>by the\
  \ equation W = integral x2 F \xB7 dx. Let's start by figuring out the units of work.\
  \ We</span> <span m='360910'>do this by analyzing our equation, which tell us that\
  \ the units of work are the units of</span> <span m='366710'>force times the units\
  \ of dx. If we forget what the units of force are, we can use unit</span> <span\
  \ m='374639'>analysis to figure it out. We know that F = ma, and acceleration is\
  \ in units of meters</span> <span m='383610'>per second squared, and mass has units\
  \ of kilograms, So the unit of force, also known</span> <span m='387110'>as the\
  \ Newton, is equivalently written as kilogram-meters per second squared. So the</span>\
  \ <span m='389740'>unit of force, also known as the Newton, is equivalently written\
  \ as kilogram-meters per</span> <span m='395830'>second squared. Recall that the\
  \ units of dx are the units of x, which is meters. Thus</span> <span m='403039'>the\
  \ unit of work is a Newton-meter. So now we know what units our answer needs to\
  \ be</span> <span m='409930'>in. So let's start solving our problem. In order to\
  \ solve our problem, we need to know</span> <span m='415669'>the force acting on\
  \ our object. We are given the mass of the object, the position function</span>\
  \ <span m='422949'>for the object, and F=ma. Because we can determine acceleration\
  \ as the second derivative of position</span> <span m='429780'>with respect to time,\
  \ we can use our given information to determine the force. Let's</span> <span m='436930'>go\
  \ ahead and solve this problem, perhaps incorrectly. See if you can catch my mistake.\
  \ Alright,</span> <span m='442060'>so here we have position as a function of time.\
  \ So let's differentiate to get the velocity.</span> <span m='447050'>Where I've\
  \ left off the decimal points. And we'll go ahead and differential the velocity</span>\
  \ <span m='453530'>to get the acceleration. And finally to get the force, we go\
  \ ahead with F=ma. So there</span> <span m='464430'>is my m. And according to this,\
  \ our expression for a is -8 + 6t. So I look at this and I</span> <span m='475259'>think\
  \ to myself, uhoh, this can't be right, because this doesn't have units of force.</span>\
  \ <span m='479940'>We know that force should have units of Newtons, but it doesn't\
  \ look like this has the correct</span> <span m='483870'>units. So this entices\
  \ us to go back into our problem to figure out what went wrong.</span> <span m='490620'>Looking\
  \ back up at the first equation for position, I see immediately that something</span>\
  \ <span m='495190'>has gone wrong, because position is in units of meters, and each\
  \ of these terms don't have</span> <span m='502190'>units of meters. In fact they\
  \ don't even agree with each other.</span> <span m='505250'>This tells me there\
  \ had to be units for each of these constants that somehow got swept</span> <span\
  \ m='511800'>under the rug. So let's be rigorous, and put those units back in. Here\
  \ we need units of</span> <span m='519219'>meters per second to cancel with the\
  \ seconds from time, and leave us with units of meters.</span> <span m='527959'>Note\
  \ that this means something physical, it is the initial velocity. Let's go back\
  \ into</span> <span m='539399'>this term here, and see that I have a t squared,\
  \ and I need something with units of meters</span> <span m='544570'>per seconds\
  \ squared if I am going to get from this term something with units of meters.</span>\
  \ <span m='549490'>And lastly, we have this term over here that has a t cubed. And\
  \ likewise the missing unit</span> <span m='556000'>must have units of meters per\
  \ second cubed, which physically is the unit of jerk, or the</span> <span m='563850'>rate\
  \ of change of acceleration.</span> <span m='564730'>Now every term has units of\
  \ meters, and so this equation makes sense. You may want to</span> <span m='567920'>pause\
  \ the video here and find the units for the constants in the formulas for velocity</span>\
  \ <span m='573060'>and acceleration. Show that these units agree with the units\
  \ you find by differentiating</span> <span m='579610'>x(t) Now that you have checked\
  \ the units of acceleration, let's put it back in the force</span> <span m='590330'>formula,\
  \ and see that everything works out ok. So we got F=ma. M as before equals 3 kilograms.</span>\
  \ <span m='595990'>And the acceleration written with correct units is negative 8\
  \ point 0 meters per second</span> <span m='600310'>squared plus 6 point 0 t meters\
  \ per second cubed. To see that this has the correct units,</span> <span m='608019'>lets\
  \ expand this formula. -24 kg m per s squared yep, that's a Newton. + 18t kg m per\
  \ s cubed.</span> <span m='622260'>Just to check, note that while this doesn't have\
  \ units of N, time has units of seconds,</span> <span m='629440'>so this term is\
  \ entirely in units of newtons as well. Now that we've verified the of Force</span>\
  \ <span m='643930'>is in units of Newtons. we can compute the work integral. That\
  \ means we want to evaluate</span> <span m='656279'>the integral: x0 to x2 of F\
  \ dx. We have an expression for F, so let's go ahead and put</span> <span m='664269'>that\
  \ in. I'm going to go ahead and leave off the units for now. We leave it as an exercise</span>\
  \ <span m='669010'>for later that you will do that. What do we get? Integral x0tox2\
  \ minus 24 plus 18t dx.</span> <span m='677890'>So we look at this and we realize\
  \ that we actually have a slight problem. Because the</span> <span m='682050'>force\
  \ is written in terms of time, and we are integrating with respect to x. Fortunately</span>\
  \ <span m='687760'>this is easy to resolve. Just remember that a small change in\
  \ x, dx is equivalently velocity</span> <span m='696850'>times a small change in\
  \ time. This is easy to see if you express velocity as dx dt, because</span> <span\
  \ m='703380'>you multiply by dt, and it is clear that this gives you a small change\
  \ in x. So in your</span> <span m='709200'>calculus class this little maneuver is\
  \ called a change of variable. So let's go ahead and</span> <span m='714389'>do\
  \ that. This means our integral can be written as an integral over time, from time\
  \ 0 to time</span> <span m='720880'>t=2 of force times velocity times dt. We write\
  \ F as ma, and we recall that acceleration is</span> <span m='731730'>the time derivative\
  \ of velocity. Now we see how to integrate this, and we find that the</span> <span\
  \ m='739120'>integral is m times velocity squared divided by 2 evaluated at the\
  \ two time end points.</span> <span m='749139'>Plugging in our formula for the velocity,\
  \ and evaluating, we get that the answer is</span> <span m='752980'>negative 12.\
  \ I intentionally left off the units while doing this computation. Now I</span>\
  \ <span m='759329'>leave it as an exercise for you to use unit analysis to check\
  \ that this integral does</span> <span m='764680'>in fact give you 12 Newton-meters\
  \ or 12 Joules, the units for work. In the example, we saw</span> <span m='778899'>that\
  \ when you are adding numbers with units, it is important for those numbers to have</span>\
  \ <span m='784290'>the same units if you want your quantity to have physical meaning.\
  \ We also learned that</span> <span m='790389'>the differential quantity dx has\
  \ the same units as x. We also saw that it is helpful</span> <span m='797660'>to\
  \ use unit analysis to check your work at points during and after the computation.\
  \ You</span> <span m='801920'>can see now that unit analysis can be a useful part\
  \ of your problem solving strategy. It</span> <span m='807149'>is important to understand\
  \ the properties of units, and how they are affected by mathematical</span> <span\
  \ m='813459'>operations. Checking units at the end of a computation useful to see\
  \ if solution is reasonable.</span> <span m='820769'>Sometimes, unit analysis can\
  \ suggest a formula for an unknown quantity in terms of given</span> <span m='826720'>information.\
  \ But physical knowledge is necessary to validate solution completely.</span> </p>"
