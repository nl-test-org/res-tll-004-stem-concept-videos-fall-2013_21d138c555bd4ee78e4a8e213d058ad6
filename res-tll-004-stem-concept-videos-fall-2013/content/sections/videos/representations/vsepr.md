transcript: "<p><span m='3639'> Molecules aren't flat. They're three dimensional,\
  \ and that has implications for their physical</span> <span m='8520'>and chemical\
  \ properties. For example, X-ray crystallography labs at MIT determine the</span>\
  \ <span m='14500'>3D shapes of protein molecules to design drugs that will fit into\
  \ these proteins. In this</span> <span m='20599'>video, you'll learn about an empirical\
  \ model chemists use to predict a molecule's 3D shape</span> <span m='26050'>from\
  \ its Lewis structure.</span> <span m='28589'>This video is part of the Representations\
  \ video series. Information can be represented</span> <span m='32720'>in words,\
  \ through mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D models. Representations are\
  \ used</span> <span m='38809'>to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding\
  \ of objects, systems, and processes.</span> <span m='44879'>Hi. My name is Cathy\
  \ Drennan and I am a professor in the chemistry department at MIT. I hope</span>\
  \ <span m='49829'>you have been enjoying your general chemistry course at SUTD.</span>\
  \ <span m='53539'>After watching this video, you will be able to use the VSEPR model\
  \ to predict 3D molecular</span> <span m='58500'>structures from 2D Lewis structures\
  \ and... ...discuss some of the assumptions of the</span> <span m='63089'>VSEPR\
  \ model. Before watching this video, you should be able to draw Lewis structures\
  \ for</span> <span m='66880'>simple molecules.</span> <span m='67759'>We can determine\
  \ molecular shape experimentally or predict it with varying degrees of accuracy</span>\
  \ <span m='68240'>using empirical and theoretical models.</span> <span m='68409'>The\
  \ model that will be introduced in this video, the Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion</span>\
  \ <span m='68850'>Model, or the VSEPR model, is an empirical model, but works quite\
  \ well for most simple</span> <span m='69659'>Because it is an empirical model,\
  \ the VSEPR model was constructed by looking for patterns</span> <span m='69810'>The\
  \ VSEPR model, which builds off of Lewis theory, is based on the idea that regions</span>\
  \ <span m='73130'>of high electron density repel one another. Let's take a look\
  \ at the Lewis structure for</span> <span m='77729'>NF3 to see what that means.\
  \ The VSEPR model focuses on the central atoms of molecules...</span> <span m='84600'>...and\
  \ assumes that bonding atoms... ...and lone pairs on the central atom are spaced</span>\
  \ <span m='90680'>as far apart as possible from each other to minimize electron\
  \ repulsions, but at the same</span> <span m='95590'>time are equidistant from the\
  \ central atom. The VSEPR model attributes lone pairs of electrons</span> <span\
  \ m='101789'>with having a stronger repulsion than bonded electrons. And finally,\
  \ the VSEPR model treats</span> <span m='106539'>multiple bonds between 2 atoms\
  \ as a single region of electron density.</span> <span m='111829'>Let's apply the\
  \ VSEPR model to a few molecules. For example, if we look at nitrous oxide,</span>\
  \ <span m='117399'>we see that there are... ...2 atoms bonded to the central atom\
  \ and zero lone pairs of</span> <span m='122570'>electrons on the central atom.\
  \ To minimize electron repulsions, we will maximize the</span> <span m='127789'>distance\
  \ between the two bonded atoms by placing them along a line on either side of the\
  \ central</span> <span m='133400'>N atom. We can also see that if we placed one\
  \ of the bonded atoms elsewhere, we would</span> <span m='139310'>not have maximized\
  \ the distance between the bonded atoms. We would describe nitrous oxide</span>\
  \ <span m='145090'>as having a linear geometry. In a linear molecule, the bond angle\
  \ between atoms is 180 degrees.</span> <span m='153250'>Note that when we examined\
  \ the Lewis structure for nitrous oxide, the triple bonded nitrogen</span> <span\
  \ m='158870'>was treated the same as the single bonded oxygen atom. Chapter Break\
  \ Now, if we followed</span> <span m='163319'>a similar procedure for sulfur trioxide,\
  \ ... we see that there are 3 atoms bonded to the central</span> <span m='169110'>atom\
  \ and zero lone pairs on the central atom. To maximize the distance of the bonding\
  \ atoms</span> <span m='174610'>from each other, we will space them 120 degrees\
  \ apart around the central atom... ...on the</span> <span m='179769'>vertices of\
  \ an equilateral triangle. We would describe sulfur trioxide as a trigonal planar</span>\
  \ <span m='186890'>molecule... ...with bond angles of 120 degrees. Chapter Break\
  \ Now let's take a look at SO2.</span> <span m='194879'>Notice that you can draw\
  \ resonance structures for SO2, but because VSEPR doesn't distinguish</span> <span\
  \ m='200159'>b/w single and multiple bonds, we can look at any resonance structure\
  \ when predicting</span> <span m='204459'>geometry. So let's just focus on one of\
  \ these structures. What do you think the geometry</span> <span m='210709'>of this\
  \ molecule will be? Pause the video, draw a picture or construct the molecule using</span>\
  \ <span m='216060'>a molecule kit, and continue playing the video to see if you\
  \ are correct.</span> <span m='221329'>Remember, the VSEPR model assumes that bonding\
  \ atoms AND lone pairs on the central atom are</span> <span m='232299'>spaced as\
  \ far apart as possible. On SO2 we have two atoms bonded to the central atom</span>\
  \ <span m='238790'>and one lone pair on the central atom. So, we have 3 regions\
  \ of electron density total.</span> <span m='245439'>Think about how you would space\
  \ these 3 regions as far apart as possible. By placing them</span> <span m='250519'>on\
  \ the vertices of an equilateral triangle. On our model, this (pointing at electron\
  \ cloud)</span> <span m='256640'>represents the lone pair of electrons. While we\
  \ have to think about lone pairs of electrons</span> <span m='262100'>when predicting\
  \ geometry, the naming convention actually ignores them. So, if we were to name</span>\
  \ <span m='268200'>this shape, we would focus on the shape that is determined by\
  \ the atoms.</span> <span m='272409'>We call this shape \"bent\". It's tempting\
  \ to say that the bond angle will be 120 degrees,</span> <span m='279390'>but bond\
  \ angles in molecules with lone pairs on the central atom have been observed to</span>\
  \ <span m='284230'>be smaller than expected. One possible explanation is that a\
  \ lone pair can spread over a larger</span> <span m='290600'>region than bonded\
  \ electrons causing the bonded atoms to move farther from the lone pair and</span>\
  \ <span m='296500'>closer to each other, compressing the bond angle. The VSEPR model\
  \ accounts for this by</span> <span m='301860'>saying that lone pairs repel more\
  \ strongly than bonded electrons. The result is that</span> <span m='307950'>the\
  \ bond angle on sulfur dioxide will be less than 120 degrees, but VSEPR theory cannot</span>\
  \ <span m='313550'>tell us what the precise bond angle will be.</span> <span m='316520'>Chapter\
  \ Break Let's do another example - CH3Cl (chloromethane, a.k.a. methyl chloride).\
  \ What</span> <span m='324680'>do you think the geometry of this molecule will be?\
  \ Pause the video, draw a picture or</span> <span m='329310'>construct the molecule\
  \ using a molecule kit, and continue playing the video to see if you</span> <span\
  \ m='333870'>are correct. How many atoms are bonded to the central atom? 4 How many\
  \ lone pairs are</span> <span m='345530'>on the central atom? 0 If we are only thinking\
  \ in 2-dimensions, it's tempting to place the</span> <span m='352750'>4 regions\
  \ of electron density at 90 degree angles to each other, ...but this would be</span>\
  \ <span m='357480'>incorrect. Remember, we're working in 3-dimensions. To maximize\
  \ the distance of 4 regions of electron</span> <span m='363710'>density, we can\
  \ think about them lying at the 4 corners of a tetrahedron. It may help</span> <span\
  \ m='369280'>to review what a tetrahedron looks like. A tetrahedron is a pyramid\
  \ constructed from</span> <span m='374020'>4 equilateral triangles. It has a triangular\
  \ base and sides made from triangles. This results</span> <span m='380590'>in 4\
  \ corners, or vertices. We imagine our central atom to be at the center of the tetrahedron.</span>\
  \ <span m='389180'>In a tetrahedral geometry, the bond angle between bonding atoms\
  \ is 109.5. This is larger</span> <span m='395630'>than the 90 degrees predicted\
  \ by putting all 4 regions in the same plane The correct model</span> <span m='401650'>of\
  \ CH3Cl would look like this. This shape is aptly named a tetrahedron. Chapter Break</span>\
  \ <span m='408990'>Let's do another example -- nitrogen trifluoride. What do you\
  \ think the geometry of this molecule</span> <span m='414810'>will be? Pause the\
  \ video, draw a picture or construct the molecule using a molecule kit,</span> <span\
  \ m='419670'>and continue playing the video to see if you are correct. How many\
  \ atoms are bonded to</span> <span m='429180'>the central atom? 3 How many lone\
  \ pairs are on the central atom? 1 Again, we have to make</span> <span m='436500'>sure\
  \ we count the lone pair of electrons. Again, to maximize the distance of 4 regions</span>\
  \ <span m='441910'>of electron density, we can think about them lying at the 4 corners\
  \ of a tetrahedron with</span> <span m='447080'>the central atom at the center of\
  \ the tetrahedron. If we build this with our kit, it looks like</span> <span m='452680'>this.\
  \ As we said earlier, the nomenclature that is used to describe molecular shapes</span>\
  \ <span m='459500'>only focuses on the positions of atoms. So, if we ignore the\
  \ lone pair, we're left with</span> <span m='463840'>a shape called a trigonal pyramid.\
  \ Because the trigonal pyramid is based off of the tetrahedron,</span> <span m='471030'>we\
  \ would normally predict the bond angles to be 109.5 degrees. However, the lone\
  \ pair</span> <span m='476830'>will repel the bonded electrons more strongly, causing\
  \ a compression of bond angles. The</span> <span m='482590'>bond angles in a trigonal\
  \ pyramid will be less than 109.5 degrees. Chapter Break Now</span> <span m='488330'>I\
  \ encourage you to predict the geometry of sulfur hexafluoride. Pause the video,\
  \ draw</span> <span m='493680'>a picture or construct the molecule using a molecule\
  \ kit, and continue playing the video</span> <span m='498440'>to see if you are\
  \ correct. How many atoms are bonded to the central atom? 6 How many</span> <span\
  \ m='510050'>lone pairs are on the central atom? 0 To maximize the distance of 6\
  \ regions of electron density,</span> <span m='517260'>they lie at the vertices\
  \ of an octahedron. Let's take a closer look at the octahedron.</span> <span m='523760'>An\
  \ octahedron is composed of 8 triangles and has 8 sides, but only 6 vertices. If\
  \ we constructed</span> <span m='541830'>sulfur hexafluoride with our kit, it would\
  \ look like this. This shape is called an octahedron.</span> <span m='549830'>The\
  \ bond angle in an octahedral geometry is 90 degrees. Chapter Break Let's try one\
  \ that's</span> <span m='555640'>a little different\u2014bromine pentafluoride.\
  \ Pause the video, draw a picture or construct</span> <span m='561590'>the molecule\
  \ using a molecule kit, and continue playing the video to see if you are correct.</span>\
  \ <span m='571830'>How many atoms are bonded to the central atom? 5 How many lone\
  \ pairs are on the central atom?</span> <span m='578860'>1 Again, to maximize the\
  \ distance of 6 regions of electron density, they lie at the vertices</span> <span\
  \ m='585710'>of an octahedron. Our model would look like this. Remember, we only\
  \ name geometric shapes</span> <span m='592780'>in chemistry based on the position\
  \ of atoms, so we ignore the lone pair. This shape is</span> <span m='597960'>called\
  \ a square pyramid. Because the square pyramid is based off of the octahedral geometry,</span>\
  \ <span m='605120'>we would normally predict the bond angles to be 90 degrees. However,\
  \ the lone pair will</span> <span m='609310'>repel the bonded electrons more strongly,\
  \ causing a compression of bond angles. The</span> <span m='615030'>bond angles\
  \ in a square pyramid will be less than 90 degrees.</span> <span m='618610'>Chapter\
  \ break These were just a few examples to help get you started with visualizing\
  \ molecules</span> <span m='624980'>in 3D. There are other variations of these base\
  \ geometries listed in your textbook that</span> <span m='627500'>you should make\
  \ sure you are familiar with. The VSEPR model is a simple, empirical model</span>\
  \ <span m='632370'>that works well for predicting the geometry of most simple molecules,\
  \ but it's important</span> <span m='637140'>to remember that as is true for all\
  \ models, it is based on some assumptions that limit</span> <span m='642970'>its\
  \ range of validity. As you progress in your studies and begin to look at more complex</span>\
  \ <span m='648200'>molecules such as proteins, you will find that you will need\
  \ to use more complicated</span> <span m='652840'>models in order to generate 3D\
  \ representations of these molecules. In this video, you learned</span> <span m='659370'>that\
  \ the VSEPR model can be used to help understand a simple molecule's 3D structure.\
  \ In order</span> <span m='666420'>to do this, you need to start with the Lewis\
  \ structure for the molecule of interest and</span> <span m='671460'>count how many\
  \ atoms are bonded to the central atom and how many lone pairs are on the central</span>\
  \ <span m='677150'>atom. Then, you need to think about how you can position those\
  \ regions as far apart from</span> <span m='684190'>one another as possible. This\
  \ is where thinking about polyhedra is useful because the vertices</span> <span\
  \ m='689990'>of polyhedra are at a maximum distance from each other. Finally, you\
  \ should remember that</span> <span m='695550'>the naming convention for molecular\
  \ geometries focuses on the locations of the atoms only.</span> <span m='702780'>Because\
  \ of the simplicity of the VSEPR model, it is an easy way for you to learn how to</span>\
  \ <span m='708000'>translate 2D representation of molecules into 3D. With some practice,\
  \ visualizing molecules</span> <span m='712740'>in 3D can become second nature to\
  \ you.</span> </p>"
