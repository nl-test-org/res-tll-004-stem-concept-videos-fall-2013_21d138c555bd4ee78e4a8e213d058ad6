transcript: "<p><span m='4290'> Here's a well-thrown disk. But have you ever thrown\
  \ one badly, so that as it spins, there's</span> <span m='10110'>a wobble? This\
  \ wobble rotates with a different frequency than the disk itself spins.</span> <span\
  \ m='17660'>In this video, we're going to describe mathematically the motion of\
  \ all of the points on this badly</span> <span m='23790'>thrown disk.</span> <span\
  \ m='25390'>This video is part of the Linearity Video Series. Many complex systems\
  \ are modeled or</span> <span m='31300'>approximated linearly because of the mathematical\
  \ advantages.</span> <span m='35820'>Hi, my name is Dan Frey, and I am a professor\
  \ of Engineering Systems and Mechanical Engineering</span> <span m='42780'>at MIT.\
  \ And I use rigid body kinematics myself when designing radio--controlled aircraft.</span>\
  \ <span m='50010'>Before watching this video, you should be familiar with eigenvalues\
  \ and eigenvectors,</span> <span m='56600'>the standard basis, e1, e2, e3 of R3,\
  \ and orthogonal matrices.</span> <span m='64509'>After watching this video, you\
  \ will be able to: identify rotation matrices; decompose</span> <span m='70530'>the\
  \ motion of the badly thrown disk into translational and rotational components;\
  \ and write the rotational</span> <span m='77680'>motion of the disk as a product\
  \ of rotation matrices.</span> <span m='87220'>Our goal is to describe the motion\
  \ of the disk. The disk is a rigid body; it doesn't</span> <span m='93170'>stretch,\
  \ bend, or deform in any way when it is thrown.</span> <span m='98670'>In this video,\
  \ we're not interested in why the disk moves the way it does\u2014that is,</span>\
  \ <span m='104479'>we're not trying to describe torques and forces that govern the\
  \ motion. We simply want to</span> <span m='109229'>describe the motion mathematically.\
  \ This is a job for rigid body kinematics. We're going</span> <span m='116490'>to\
  \ describe the motion by decomposing it into translational and rotational components.</span>\
  \ <span m='123630'>We'll start with the mathematics of rotation matrices.</span>\
  \ <span m='127630'>This will allow us to build up to a description of the wobbly\
  \ disk.</span> <span m='131560'>Finally, we'll complete the description of the wobbly\
  \ disk by adding in the translational</span> <span m='137129'>component.</span>\
  \ <span m='138169'>Let's start with some linear algebra. A rotation is a mapping\
  \ that takes any vector</span> <span m='144060'>in R3 to some other vector in R3\
  \ via rotation about some axis by some angle.</span> <span m='154239'>Rotations\
  \ don't change the length of a vector. So, if you scale a vector and then rotate</span>\
  \ <span m='159930'>it, you get the same thing as if you first rotate it, and then\
  \ scale the vector.</span> <span m='166790'>Also, if you take two vectors, sum them\
  \ and then rotate the sum, this is equal to vector</span> <span m='176040'>you would\
  \ get if you first rotate both vectors and then add them.</span> <span m='181469'>These\
  \ two properties together mean that Rotations act linearly on vectors.</span> <span\
  \ m='187510'>And by definition, linear operations can be represented by matrices.</span>\
  \ <span m='193529'>But what does a rotation matrix look like?</span> <span m='197779'>We\
  \ can learn a lot about a matrix by examining its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\
  \ Recall that</span> <span m='205129'>a vector v is an eigenvector of a matrix if\
  \ it is sent to a scalar multiple of itself</span> <span m='212099'>when acted upon\
  \ by the matrix.</span> <span m='215168'>That scalar is the eigenvalue.</span> <span\
  \ m='219400'>Consider a rotation of 60 degrees about the axis defined by the vector\
  \ e1+e2. Pause the</span> <span m='226989'>video here and determine one eigenvalue\
  \ and eigenvector. By the definition of an eigenvector,</span> <span m='241029'>the\
  \ vector e1+e2, which points along the axis of rotation, is an eigenvector with\
  \ eigenvalue</span> <span m='248150'>one. This is because this vector is UNCHANGED\
  \ by the rotation matrix.</span> <span m='255019'>Suppose you have a rotation matrix\
  \ such that e1 and e2 are both eigenvectors with eigenvalue</span> <span m='263150'>1.</span>\
  \ <span m='265060'>What would this mean about the rotation? Pause the video and\
  \ think about this. The entire</span> <span m='276470'>xy-plane will be unchanged\
  \ by this rotation. This is only possible if the matrix is the</span> <span m='283280'>identity\
  \ matrix! This is the null rotation... nothing happens! What are the eigenvalues</span>\
  \ <span m='292680'>and eigenvectors of a 180-degree rotation about the z-axis?</span>\
  \ <span m='306040'>This rotation matrix has one eigenvalue of 1, corresponding to\
  \ the vector e3, which points</span> <span m='312560'>along the axis of rotation.</span>\
  \ <span m='315310'>But it has more eigenvectors: any vector in the xy-plane is sent\
  \ to its negative by the</span> <span m='322280'>rotation, so any vector in the\
  \ xy-plane is an eigenvector with eigenvalue -1.</span> <span m='332740'>Now let's\
  \ consider a rotation by some angle theta (that is not an integer multiple of</span>\
  \ <span m='339370'>pi) clockwise about the z-axis.</span> <span m='343220'>Write\
  \ a matrix that represents such a rotation.</span> <span m='349490'>Compute the\
  \ eigenvalues of this matrix, and use the definition of an eigenvector to explain</span>\
  \ <span m='355870'>why this makes sense.</span> <span m='365060'>You should have\
  \ found 1 real eigenvalue equal to 1, and two complex conjugate eigenvalues.</span>\
  \ <span m='372980'>The real eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector e3, which\
  \ is sent to itself by the rotation,</span> <span m='379610'>hence the eigenvalue\
  \ of 1.</span> <span m='382450'>The fact that the other two eigenvalues are complex\
  \ means that no other vector is sent</span> <span m='389230'>to a REAL scalar multiple\
  \ of itself.</span> <span m='394110'>This makes sense geometrically because NO other\
  \ vector points in the same direction</span> <span m='399000'>it started in after\
  \ being rotated. Now, how do we describe any general rotation about</span> <span\
  \ m='408370'>an arbitrary axis?</span> <span m='410540'>Well, a matrix is completely\
  \ defined by how it acts on basis vectors.</span> <span m='418370'>Since a rotation\
  \ doesn't change the lengths of vectors or the angles BETWEEN two vectors,</span>\
  \ <span m='424090'>a rotated basis will also be a basis for R3!</span> <span m='429980'>This\
  \ tells us that any rotation matrix can be described as an orthonormal matrix.</span>\
  \ <span m='437830'>The columns are the vectors each standard basis vector is sent\
  \ to.</span> <span m='443490'>Is it true that ALL orthonormal matrices rotate vectors?\
  \ Pause the video. Nope, here's an</span> <span m='457960'>orthonormal matrix that's\
  \ not a rotation; it's a reflection.</span> <span m='462650'>The rule is that only\
  \ an orthonormal matrix whose determinant is positive 1 is a rotation.</span> <span\
  \ m='476370'>But let's get back to thinking about rigid body KINEMATICS. Remember,\
  \ we want to describe</span> <span m='482810'>the motion of the disk. We've talked\
  \ about rotation matrices, but we've left out a very</span> <span m='488520'>important\
  \ component: time! How will we describe time dependent rotation?</span> <span m='496180'>That's\
  \ right, time dependent matrices. Let's start by modeling a simple motion: the</span>\
  \ <span m='505010'>rotation of a disk as it spins clockwise about the positive z-axis.</span>\
  \ <span m='511880'>We know how to write a matrix that describes rotation by an angle\
  \ theta about the z-axis.</span> <span m='519698'>How would you make this rotation\
  \ time dependent? Pause the video and discuss.</span> <span m='531160'>The obvious\
  \ choice here is to simply make theta a function of time! But how does it</span>\
  \ <span m='537709'>depend on time? To write an explicit function, we need to</span>\
  \ <span m='543019'>know the rate, omega, at which the disk is rotating.</span> <span\
  \ m='548529'>Assume the disk spins with constant angular velocity.</span> <span\
  \ m='552829'>We can easily calculate omega by counting the revolutions per second.</span>\
  \ <span m='558009'>And there's our matrix for a spinning\u2014but not wobbling\u2014\
  disk.</span> <span m='564889'>Now let's try a slightly more difficult example. Let's\
  \ describe the motion of this wobbly,</span> <span m='571930'>spinning disk as it\
  \ rotates on this stick.</span> <span m='576329'>The disk is itself rotating clockwise\
  \ about its center of mass when viewed from the positive</span> <span m='583149'>z-axis.\
  \ As before, we can find the rotation rate, omega-D, of a marked point by counting</span>\
  \ <span m='592420'>the revolutions per second. Assume omega_D is constant. Now,\
  \ observe the slight tilt</span> <span m='602540'>of the disk off of horizontal.</span>\
  \ <span m='605980'>This tilt is created by a rotation about a tilt axis.</span>\
  \ <span m='611649'>The tilt axis is the vector in the xy-plane about which the disk\
  \ is rotated by some small</span> <span m='618939'>angle theta, creating the tilt.\
  \ The wobble is created because the tilt axis is rotating</span> <span m='627230'>clockwise\
  \ about the positive z-axis.</span> <span m='631850'>We can visualize this by observing\
  \ that the normal vector to the disk rotates in a cone</span> <span m='638290'>shape\
  \ about the z-axis. By tracking the normal vector's revolutions per second, we can\
  \ find</span> <span m='646800'>the rotation rate of the wobble, omega-W, of the\
  \ normal vector. This is also the rotation</span> <span m='654089'>rate for tilt\
  \ axis. We assume omega_W is constant. Notice that omega-D and omega-W are different</span>\
  \ <span m='663420'>rotation rates. For simplicity, we assume that the marked</span>\
  \ <span m='668149'>point begins along the x-axis; and the initial tilt axis aligns\
  \ with the x-axis, with the</span> <span m='676920'>tilt angle theta.</span> <span\
  \ m='679490'>Let's start by creating a sequence of rotations that rotates the marked\
  \ point to the angle</span> <span m='685449'>omega_D times t and the tilt axis to\
  \ the angle omega_W times t for any time t.</span> <span m='696220'>To describe\
  \ this motion, we are going to decompose the behavior into a sequence of rotations</span>\
  \ <span m='701410'>about e1, e2, and e3, which have the benefit of being easy to\
  \ describe mathematically.</span> <span m='709369'>I want to start by eliminating\
  \ the tilt of the disk, so we can imagine it spinning parallel</span> <span m='715910'>to\
  \ the ground.</span> <span m='718199'>What is the matrix that undoes the tilt of\
  \ theta degrees about the x-axis? Pause and</span> <span m='725929'>write down a\
  \ matrix. We rotate by an angle negative theta about the positive x-axis,</span>\
  \ <span m='738610'>which is represented by this matrix.</span> <span m='741170'>Now,\
  \ I rotate the marked point clockwise about the z-axis by the angle (omega_D minus\
  \ omega_W)</span> <span m='753009'>times t.</span> <span m='754920'>This matrix\
  \ describes the angle difference traveled by the marked point relative to the</span>\
  \ <span m='761009'>position of the tilt axis. Now, we need to make sure that we\
  \ tilt the disk again so that</span> <span m='769470'>we can describe the wobble.</span>\
  \ <span m='772079'>Since we assume the tilt axis begins along the x-axis, we rotate\
  \ the disk back to the</span> <span m='778709'>initial tilted position by theta\
  \ degrees.</span> <span m='782869'>This counterclockwise, time-independent rotation\
  \ about the x-axis is represented by this matrix.</span> <span m='793369'>Finally\
  \ we must describe the wobble, created by the rotation of the tilt axis. The tilt</span>\
  \ <span m='799069'>axis is rotating clockwise about the positive z-axis with rotation\
  \ rate omega-W, so at time</span> <span m='808069'>t, it has rotated by omega_W\
  \ t degrees, which is what this matrix does.</span> <span m='816720'>How will we\
  \ combine these matrices to describe the motion of the marked point?</span> <span\
  \ m='821920'>Pause and discuss.</span> <span m='829660'>We multiply the matrices\
  \ together. The order we apply each matrix matters. We must perform</span> <span\
  \ m='837989'>the rotations in the same order we decomposed the motion, because matrices\
  \ do not multiply</span> <span m='845379'>commutatively.</span> <span m='850970'>Let's\
  \ understand geometrically why this worked. The angle of the marker is changed in\
  \ two</span> <span m='857809'>steps of this process, first a rotation by angle omega-D\
  \ minus omega-W times t, and then</span> <span m='868519'>by an angle omega_W times\
  \ t.</span> <span m='872110'>In the end, it ends up exactly where it should, at\
  \ omega-D times t. Only the final matrix</span> <span m='880230'>affects the tilt\
  \ axis, rotating it by the angle omega-W times t.</span> <span m='887600'>Because\
  \ the disk is a rigid object, by describing the position of the marked point and\
  \ the tilt</span> <span m='894149'>axis for all times with matrices, we've actually\
  \ described the position of every point on the</span> <span m='901649'>disk.</span>\
  \ <span m='903029'>We can find the location of any point at time t by applying this\
  \ matrix operation to any</span> <span m='909499'>vector on the initial disk. Now,\
  \ let's go back to the badly thrown disk.</span> <span m='917689'>We can apply the\
  \ rotational transformation directly to our thrown disk.</span> <span m='921519'>The\
  \ only changes might be to the rotation rates and the initial position. You can\
  \ think</span> <span m='923309'>about how we might change the formula. We'll ignore\
  \ that. So all that is left to consider</span> <span m='925809'>is the translation.</span>\
  \ <span m='929739'>If you throw a disk and watch it from the side, we can ignore\
  \ the rotations and focus</span> <span m='934489'>on the translation of the center\
  \ point of the disk. For the small time interval that</span> <span m='940429'>we\
  \ are interested in describing, the disk moves in a straight, horizontal path. So\
  \ this</span> <span m='946329'>vector equation approximates the translation.</span>\
  \ <span m='951709'>Because the disk is a rigid object, we get the full description\
  \ of the motion by simply</span> <span m='956149'>adding in the translation.</span>\
  \ <span m='958089'>To the rotation of the wobbly disk to obtain the following equation\
  \ of motion for any point</span> <span m='963509'>on the disk.</span> <span m='966100'>If\
  \ you thought this problem was cool, you're not the only one. Richard Feynman studied</span>\
  \ <span m='970489'>the kinematics AND the dynamics of the wobbly disk. He was able\
  \ to show that the rotation</span> <span m='976319'>rate of the special marked point,\
  \ omega-D, was exactly twice the rotation rate, omega-W,</span> <span m='982769'>of\
  \ the tilt axis. This realization ultimately led to insights into the behavior of\
  \ electrons.</span> <span m='994059'>In this video, we saw that rotation matrices\
  \ are orthogonal matrices with determinant equal</span> <span m='1000819'>to positive\
  \ 1.</span> <span m='1003059'>The kinematics of rigid bodies involves breaking a\
  \ problem into translation and rotation.</span> <span m='1009910'>The rotations\
  \ may be decomposed into several time dependent rotation matrices that are</span>\
  \ <span m='1015709'>multiplied together.</span> <span m='1018160'>The matrix product\
  \ added to the translation describes the location at any time of all</span> <span\
  \ m='1024030'>points on the rigid body.</span> <span m='1026319'>I hope you'll try\
  \ to describe the motions of various rotating objects that you encounter.</span>\
  \ <span m='1030800'>Have fun, and good luck!</span> </p>"
