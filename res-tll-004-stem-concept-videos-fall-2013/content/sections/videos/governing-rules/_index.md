Entropy is described as a measure of the number of possible ways energy can be distributed in a system of molecules. Students apply this description to understand the entropy change in a heat diffusion experiment. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Describe, at a basic level, the concept of a microstate. Discuss what entropy measures in a conceptual way.

Each example is illustrated and connected to the model that best describes it. At the end of the video, students are asked to analyze a set of systems involving gravity. Students see examples and analyze the information needed to describe the system fully. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Recognize the three most common models of gravity and their equations. Analyze situations involving gravity in preparation for problem-solving.

Students are also introduced to the concept of mean free path. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Discuss the physical significance of a gas molecules mean free path. Discuss the physical parameters that affect the mean free path.

Students brainstorm a list about this topic at the beginning, and compare it to the items that are described as the video progresses. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Describe events and devices in terms of Maxwell’s Equations. Decide which equation relates to which phenomena.

Each law is examined in a separate chapter of the video, with replays and voice-overs emphasizing particular points. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Recognize Newtons Laws. Attribute physical events to the action of a particular law.
