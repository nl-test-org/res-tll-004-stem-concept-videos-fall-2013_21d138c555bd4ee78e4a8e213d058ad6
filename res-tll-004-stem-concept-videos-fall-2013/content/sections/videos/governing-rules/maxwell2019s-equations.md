  modulated radio, or AM radio for short, was developed in the early 1900s and was
  the first method of broadcasting sound via radio waves. Like all electromagnetic
  phenomena, AM radio can be described quantitatively using Maxwell''s equations.
  In this video, we''ll describe each step of the AM broadcasting process, from transmission
  to reception to playback on a speaker. As you''ll see, Maxwell''s equations can
  be used to describe and gain insight into each step of the process.</p> <p>This
  video is part of the Governing Rules video series.  A small number of rules describe
  the physical and chemical interactions that are possible in our universe.</p> <p>Hello.
  My name is Steven Leeb. I am a professor in the electrical engineering and computer
  science department at MIT, and today I''ll be talking with you about Maxwell''s
  Equations.</p> <p>This video assumes that you have a working understanding of all
  four of Maxwell''s Equations. We assume that you have seen them, made calculations
  with them, and understand the various terms, but not that you are an expert. You
  should also know how to use the Right-Hand Rule to determine the direction of electric
  and magnetic fields.</p> <p>Our objective is to improve your ability to describe
  events and devices in terms of Maxwell''s equations. This includes deciding which
  equation would be appropriate for a given situation.</p> <p>Let''s begin with an
  overview of radio broadcasting. We''ll be discussing AM radio, as it is probably
  the simplest sort of broadcasting.</p> <p>There are four basic things we need to
  look at today: the transmitter, which sends the radio waves; the radio waves themselves;
  the receiver that detects them, and the speakers that turn the receiver''s signal
  into sound.</p> <p>This picture shows an overview of the process. The transmitting
  tower, on the left, produces radio waves that travel through the air until a receiver
  detects them and sends a signal to a speaker. The tower is typically about one hundred
  meters tall, and the receiver is about ten centimeters wide.</p> <p>The transmitter
  is a tall metal tower with alternating current attached to it at high voltage. In
  AM radio, the whole tower is electrified. The entire thing acts as the antenna,
  which is not true for all types of broadcasting, such as for FM radio or cell towers.</p>
  <p>This next diagram shows the radio waves as they move outward from the transmitter.
  Specifically, it shows the electric part of the electromagnetic waves. You can see
  their shape drawn in orange, and their magnitude shown in black below that.</p>
  <p>Next we have the receiver. The receiver is a set of wire coils. These detect
  the radio wave and transmit a signal to a stereo system so that you can hear the
  sound.</p> <p>Our final piece is the speakers, which turn electrical impulses into
  sound that you can hear.</p> <p>Now it''s your turn. With a partner, try to describe
  where each of Maxwell''s Equations comes into play in this situation. It may help
  you to break the situation down, draw diagrams, write the laws down, consider the
  terms in the equations, and perhaps even redraw the pictures.</p> <p>Pause the video
  here to discuss and consider the possibilities.</p> <p>Now that you''ve had time
  to think, it''s time for a discussion. Your professor will lead the class through
  sharing the ideas and diagrams you came up with. At this stage we will not be deciding
  whether any ideas are right or not - the idea is just to get everyone''s ideas out
  in the open.</p> <p>Pause the video here for the discussion.</p> <p>Now that you''ve
  had time to share some of your ideas, let''s get an expert look at where Maxwell''s
  Equations apply to broadcasting.</p> <p>Make sure to note whether or not you thought
  of each of these situations as we describe them. You may be missing some, or you
  may have even come up with a few more. We will return to your brainstorms in a minute.</p>
  <p>Let''s examine the transmitting tower first. The AC generator will drive positive
  charges to one end of the tower, and negative charges to the other. Using Gauss''
  Law, we can surround each of these with a Gaussian surface. Our electric field lines
  will point outward from the positive charges, and inward toward the negative charges.</p>
  <p>In addition, because this is an AC power source, our positive and negative charges
  will constantly be shifting from one end of the tower to the other.</p> <p>After
  many cycles of this, we will end up with an electric field radiating outward from
  the tower. That field changes direction every half-cycle.</p> <p>Let''s look at
  the tower again in a different way. If we consider the current rather than the charges,
  we know that it will be moving up and down the tower. To analyze the magnetic field
  the current creates, we can use Ampere''s Law, and draw an Amperian loop around
  the tower.</p> <p>The Right-Hand Rule will give us the direction of the magnetic
  field from this current, which will change as the current changes direction. As
  with the electric field, this magnetic field will oscillate and change direction
  with time.</p> <p>While we look at this view, we can also work in another one of
  Maxwell''s Equations, sometimes called Gauss'' Law for Magnetism or the Statement
  of No Magnetic Monopoles. You can see that, like all magnetic field lines, the magnetic
  field lines created by our tower have no start point or end point. They wrap around
  the tower and connect with themselves.</p> <p>Let''s move on to the radio waves.
  As they move, the electric field at each point in space changes. That leads us to
  the Ampere-Maxwell Law, which handles changes in electric flux. The law states that
  a change in electric flux will induce a magnetic field. We can draw that in on our
  picture.</p> <p>When we look at the magnetic field, it also changes in time. Faraday''s
  Law handles changing magnetic flux, and tells us that it induces an electric field.
  Again, the two fields are perpendicular.</p> <p>When our electric field reaches
  the antenna, we would be tempted to use the Ampere-Maxwell Law again. We know that
  there is a change in the electric field, which would induce a magnetic field...
  but magnetic fields are not easy to detect. This method is not very useful.</p>
  <p>Instead, AM antennas rely on Faraday''s Law. Faraday''s Law states that changes
  in the magnetic flux will induce an electric field.  As the electromagnetic wave
  passes through the antenna, the electric field in the loop will generate a current,
  which is easy to detect! We can plug this antenna into our stereo and hear the sound
  that comes out.</p> <p>Now it''s time to look at the speaker. Here is some video
  from my laboratory at MIT.</p> <p>In general, we have two categories to consider.
  A charge or a current can create a field, and we use Gauss'' Law or Ampere''s Law
  to investigate. If we have oscillating fields, we switch to Faraday''s Law or Ampere''s
  law with Maxwell''s extension. We also can''t forget the Lorentz Force Law. While
  it''s not one of Maxwell''s equations, it''s still very important to the study of
  electromagnetism.</p> <p>Now it''s time to return to your brainstorms. Your professor
  will lead the class in a discussion and examination of the brainstorms you presented
  before.</p> <p>Remember that there are many different ways in which Maxwell''s Equations
  can describe electromagnetic phenomena. Just because something on your list was
  not on our list does not mean that you were wrong.</p> <p>I hope you appreciated
  our discussion of radio today. Good luck in your further studies of Maxwell''s Equations.</p>'
