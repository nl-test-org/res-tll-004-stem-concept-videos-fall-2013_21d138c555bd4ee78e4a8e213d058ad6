title: Rotating Frames of Reference
transcript: "<p><span m='2970'> Here you see footage of hurricanes that formed in\
  \ the Atlantic Ocean during 2009. Do you</span> <span m='8980'>see that every single\
  \ hurricane rotates counterclockwise? All hurricanes formed in the Northern hemisphere</span>\
  \ <span m='14860'>rotate counterclockwise.</span> <span m='16830'>In this video,\
  \ we'll provide you with the tools to explain why hurricanes rotate the</span> <span\
  \ m='21320'>way that they do.</span> <span m='23060'>This video is part of the Representations\
  \ video series. Information can be represented</span> <span m='27759'>in words,\
  \ through mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D models. Representations are\
  \ used</span> <span m='34440'>to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding\
  \ of objects, systems, and processes.</span> <span m='40590'>Hi, my name is Sanjay\
  \ Sarma, and I am a professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. Today we</span>\
  \ <span m='46640'>are going to demystify the origins of the forces that appear to\
  \ act on objects in rotating</span> <span m='53610'>frames.</span> <span m='55040'>Before\
  \ watching this video, you should be familiar with how to define basis vectors;</span>\
  \ <span m='60120'>inertial and non-inertial reference frames; and the representation\
  \ of rotation rates as</span> <span m='65720'>a vector cross products.</span> <span\
  \ m='67610'>After watching this video, you will be able to explain why centrifugal\
  \ and Coriolis forces</span> <span m='73780'>arise in rotating frames of reference,\
  \ and apply your understanding of the Coriolis force</span> <span m='79539'>to determine\
  \ the direction of rotation of hurricanes.</span> <span m='87000'>A frame of reference\
  \ is a choice of coordinate frame, a set of orthonormal basis vectors.</span> <span\
  \ m='92720'>The frame is allowed to undergo rigid body motions.</span> <span m='95940'>Rigid\
  \ body motions include translation, rotation, or a combination of translation and\
  \ rotation.</span> <span m='102350'>As a frame of reference undergoes a rigid body\
  \ motion, the 3 basis vectors retain their</span> <span m='107590'>unit length and\
  \ remain mutually orthogonal.</span> <span m='111509'>In this video, we are going\
  \ to focus on rotating frames of reference. In particular, we want</span> <span\
  \ m='117090'>to think about frames that are rotating with constant angular velocity\
  \ and that aren't</span> <span m='122240'>translating.</span> <span m='124180'>Rotating\
  \ frames of reference are non-inertial, thus we detect fictitious forces in them.</span>\
  \ <span m='129590'>We are going to explain how these so called fictitious forces\
  \ arise.</span> <span m='134470'>This is a turntable. We say that we are in the\
  \ turntable frame of reference because the</span> <span m='139170'>camera is mounted\
  \ to the turntable. From this frame of reference, it appears that the turntable</span>\
  \ <span m='145610'>is stationary as the world spins around us, despite the fact\
  \ that our experience tells</span> <span m='151300'>us it is the turntable that\
  \ is spinning.</span> <span m='155150'>Here you see an orange disk attached to the\
  \ turntable by a string. If we rotate the turntable</span> <span m='160840'>quickly\
  \ enough to overcome the friction between the disk and the turntable, you notice\
  \ that</span> <span m='166760'>the string becomes taut.</span> <span m='169020'>Newton's\
  \ second law implies that there must be a force equal and opposite to this tension</span>\
  \ <span m='173910'>force for the disk to remain stationary!</span> <span m='176819'>This\
  \ apparent force is what we call a fictitious force. Let's rotate the turntable\
  \ with two</span> <span m='182520'>disks\u2014one is attached to the table by a\
  \ string, while the other is unattached. The</span> <span m='187840'>fictitious\
  \ force causes the unattached disk to fly off of the Turntable.</span> <span m='192780'>Is\
  \ there really a force? If so, where does it come from? Pause the video and discuss.</span>\
  \ <span m='206420'>In addition to the Turntable frame, there is another frame of\
  \ reference that will be</span> <span m='210540'>useful in our analysis.</span>\
  \ <span m='212420'>This is the ground frame, G, which is any coordinate frame that\
  \ appears to be stationary</span> <span m='217230'>while standing on the ground.</span>\
  \ <span m='219129'>The Turntable frame, T, refers to any coordinate frame that appears\
  \ stationary while standing</span> <span m='225099'>on the Turntable.</span> <span\
  \ m='227280'>From the ground frame, the T frame is rotating counterclockwise with\
  \ constant angular velocity,</span> <span m='233000'>or almost constant angular\
  \ velocity.</span> <span m='236090'>It is important to be explicit about the particular\
  \ frame of reference used to describe a velocity</span> <span m='241209'>or acceleration\
  \ vector.</span> <span m='243700'>The velocity of the stationary vector is zero\
  \ in the G frame, but the velocity of the rotating</span> <span m='248550'>vector\
  \ is zero in the T frame.</span> <span m='251159'>We will denote the frame of such\
  \ a vector by using a left superscript G or T to designate</span> <span m='257159'>if\
  \ we are considering the vector as an object in the G frame or the T frame.</span>\
  \ <span m='262810'>In the T frame, the position of the disk is fixed, so its velocity\
  \ and acceleration are</span> <span m='267840'>both zero.</span> <span m='269370'>Pause\
  \ the video here to determine the velocity of the disk as seen from the ground frame.</span>\
  \ <span m='281740'>According to the G frame, the T frame is rotating with some angular\
  \ velocity, represented by</span> <span m='286590'>the vector omega. Omega points\
  \ along the axis of rotation with magnitude equal to the angular</span> <span m='293060'>velocity.\
  \ The velocity of the disk according to the G frame is entirely due to the rotation</span>\
  \ <span m='298940'>of the T frame, and thus can be represented by omega cross r.</span>\
  \ <span m='305120'>Recall that in general, any object that is moving on the turntable\
  \ will have a velocity</span> <span m='310770'>that can be defined in the T-frame.\
  \ The velocity in the G-frame can be found as the sum of</span> <span m='317150'>the\
  \ velocity in the T-frame and the velocity that arises due to the rotation of the\
  \ T-frame</span> <span m='323270'>with respect to the G-frame.</span> <span m='326150'>We\
  \ can think of this as a rule for taking the time derivative of the position vector</span>\
  \ <span m='330900'>r in both the G-frame and the T-frame.</span> <span m='334280'>We\
  \ can generalize this as a formula for how to take the time derivative in the G\
  \ frame</span> <span m='339259'>of any vector, x, in terms of its T-frame derivative.\
  \ This formula holds when the T</span> <span m='345680'>frame is rotating, but not\
  \ translating with respect to the G frame.</span> <span m='350960'>Use this formula\
  \ to take the time derivative of velocity. Try to find the general formula</span>\
  \ <span m='356370'>for the acceleration in the ground frame in terms of the acceleration\
  \ in the turntable</span> <span m='361729'>frame and various other terms. Pause\
  \ the video while you carry out the computation.</span> <span m='383580'>Looking\
  \ at this formula, the first term is the object's acceleration as observed in the</span>\
  \ <span m='388440'>T frame. The remaining terms can be thought of as giving rise\
  \ to the fictitious forces,</span> <span m='394300'>which cause the acceleration\
  \ observed in the T frame. The second term is the due to the</span> <span m='400500'>angular\
  \ acceleration of the T frame with respect to the G frame. This third term is the\
  \ Coriolis</span> <span m='406680'>acceleration\u2014note that it depends on the\
  \ velocity vector of the object in the T frame.</span> <span m='413360'>And this\
  \ last term is the centripetal acceleration\u2014observe that it depends on how\
  \ far the object is from</span> <span m='419990'>the axis of rotation.</span> <span\
  \ m='422919'>Given this information, pause the video and determine the acceleration\
  \ of the orange disk</span> <span m='428330'>in the ground frame?</span> <span m='437169'>The\
  \ velocity and acceleration of the disk are zero in the T frame of reference.</span>\
  \ <span m='442650'>We did our best to rotate the turntable in this video with constant\
  \ angular velocity.</span> <span m='447560'>So we will assume that the angular acceleration\
  \ is negligible.</span> <span m='451330'>Thus the acceleration in the G-frame is\
  \ given completely by the centripetal acceleration</span> <span m='457460'>term.</span>\
  \ <span m='458889'>This vector points in the negative r direction with a magnitude\
  \ given by the distance from</span> <span m='465009'>the axis multiplied by the\
  \ angular velocity squared.</span> <span m='470020'>In the G frame, which is inertial,\
  \ we do not observe effects of the so-called \"fictitious</span> <span m='475479'>forces\"\
  . Remember, the disk wants to move in a straight line. It doesn't want to turn.</span>\
  \ <span m='482130'>The string imparts a tension force upon the orange disk, which\
  \ provides the centripetal</span> <span m='486940'>acceleration needed for the disk\
  \ to rotate with the Turntable.</span> <span m='491910'>But in the non-inertial\
  \ T frame, we may think we observe a \"fictitious force\". The only</span> <span\
  \ m='497650'>thing that is fictitious is your perception that the disk is not accelerating.\
  \ It is a</span> <span m='502889'>\"physical illusion\" created by the fact that\
  \ from the turntable frame of reference, you</span> <span m='507860'>don't observe\
  \ the centripetal acceleration of the turntable.</span> <span m='516209'>In this\
  \ video clip, we are rolling tennis balls through a plastic tube. In the T frame,</span>\
  \ <span m='521929'>we observe that the ball moves along a curved path. The curved\
  \ motion observed in a rotating</span> <span m='527819'>frame of reference is called\
  \ the \"Coriolis Effect.\"</span> <span m='531769'>Pause the video and explain what\
  \ you think is causing this curved motion.</span> <span m='543550'>To better understand\
  \ what is happening, let's look at the same motion from the inertial</span> <span\
  \ m='547949'>ground frame.</span> <span m='549860'>But first, what do you think\
  \ the motion of the ball will be when observed from the Ground</span> <span m='554029'>frame?\
  \ Pause the video and make a prediction.</span> <span m='564989'>That's right. The\
  \ path is a rather straight line along the initial trajectory!</span> <span m='570110'>It\
  \ is the motion of the turntable that is curved as the turntable rotates counterclockwise.</span>\
  \ <span m='576790'>But from the turntable frame, points on the turntable appear\
  \ stationary, because you are</span> <span m='581699'>rotating with the frame. So\
  \ you perceive that the ball is curving to the right, even though</span> <span m='587819'>it\
  \ is you that is moving in a circular path.</span> <span m='591050'>You might try\
  \ to explain the curvature using fictitious forces. But we know that these</span>\
  \ <span m='596230'>forces are really just accelerations of the turntable frame that\
  \ we do not perceive.</span> <span m='602790'>Let's use what we know about the G\
  \ frame to understand what these accelerations are in</span> <span m='607790'>the\
  \ T frame.</span> <span m='609559'>Using the general formula for acceleration in\
  \ a rotating frame that we found earlier,</span> <span m='615309'>pause here and\
  \ determine the acceleration in the T frame.</span> <span m='624860'>Because the\
  \ velocity is essentially constant in the G frame, the G frame acceleration is</span>\
  \ <span m='630199'>zero.</span> <span m='631799'>We can rearrange the remaining\
  \ nonzero terms to find an expression for the acceleration</span> <span m='637110'>of\
  \ the ball that we observe in the T frame. We find it is equal and opposite the\
  \ sum of</span> <span m='644029'>the Coriolis acceleration and the Centripetal acceleration.</span>\
  \ <span m='648739'>This term is the negative of the Centripetal acceleration, which\
  \ we saw in the previous</span> <span m='653720'>example. This acceleration is always\
  \ pointing outwards from the center of rotation.</span> <span m='659209'>This second\
  \ term is the negative Coriolis acceleration. This acceleration is perpendicular</span>\
  \ <span m='666059'>to the velocity of the ball in the T frame, creating the curvature\
  \ of the ball's path.</span> <span m='672220'>We've said the accelerations are created\
  \ by the rotation of the turntable. How does this</span> <span m='677360'>happen?</span>\
  \ <span m='678489'>For an object to rotate with the turntable, a centripetal acceleration\
  \ is required. Without</span> <span m='684149'>it, an object appears to move outwards\
  \ from the center of rotation.</span> <span m='689339'>Even more is happening though.\
  \ Because of the rigid body rotation, the velocity of a</span> <span m='694149'>point\
  \ near the outside edge of the turntable is greater than the velocity of point near</span>\
  \ <span m='698689'>the center of rotation.</span> <span m='700889'>Moving objects\
  \ accelerate due to this velocity differential. The acceleration is perpendicular</span>\
  \ <span m='706290'>to the velocity of the object. But you don't realize this acceleration\
  \ exists from the</span> <span m='711449'>turntable frame, because you don't perceive\
  \ your own rotation.</span> <span m='714819'>The acceleration created by this velocity\
  \ differential between points on the turntable</span> <span m='715309'>is responsible\
  \ for the Coriolis effect, curving the paths of moving objects.</span> <span m='715809'>You\
  \ can feel these accelerations yourself if you walk around on a carousel. Or you\
  \ can</span> <span m='720049'>try waving your arms or legs on some other rotating\
  \ theme park ride.</span> <span m='726720'>Remember, the Earth is a rotating reference\
  \ frame. Even though we are used to considering</span> <span m='734920'>the Earth\
  \ as a fixed frame, some phenomena, such as hurricanes, are created by the rotation</span>\
  \ <span m='740819'>of the Earth. We are going to use what we learned earlier to\
  \ understand why hurricanes</span> <span m='746239'>rotate the way they do.</span>\
  \ <span m='748459'>We can model regions of the Earth quite easily. For points that\
  \ are in the Northern or Southern</span> <span m='753739'>hemisphere, but sufficiently\
  \ far from the equator, we can model the hemisphere by projecting</span> <span m='758509'>it\
  \ onto a disk.</span> <span m='760970'>From this perspective, the northern hemisphere\
  \ is a counterclockwise rotating disk, and the</span> <span m='765929'>southern\
  \ hemisphere is a clockwise rotating disk.</span> <span m='769589'>Near the equator,\
  \ we can't model the Earth as a disk. Instead, a better model would be</span> <span\
  \ m='774799'>the outside surface of a rotating cylinder.</span> <span m='778359'>Our\
  \ understanding of the Coriolis Effect from the turntable will directly apply to\
  \ this</span> <span m='783429'>model of the hemispheres.</span> <span m='785399'>Now\
  \ let's start by thinking about hurricanes. Hurricanes are formed when there are\
  \ small</span> <span m='790549'>regions of very low air pressure. The existence\
  \ of this low-pressure region causes air from</span> <span m='797980'>all directions\
  \ to move towards the low-pressure zone.</span> <span m='801980'>With this information\
  \ and what you know about the Coriolis effect, explain why hurricanes</span> <span\
  \ m='807109'>in the northern hemisphere rotate counterclockwise.</span> <span m='818290'>As\
  \ air moves towards the low-pressure zone, the air moving from the south veers to\
  \ the</span> <span m='823519'>right due to the Coriolis effect. Similarly, air moving\
  \ from the north veers to the left</span> <span m='830169'>of the low-pressure zone.\
  \ At the same time, air is constantly pulled in towards the low-pressure</span>\
  \ <span m='836259'>zone. The combination of these processes creates a region of\
  \ counterclockwise rotating air.</span> <span m='843910'>This is why hurricanes\
  \ in the Northern hemisphere rotate counterclockwise.</span> <span m='852139'>In\
  \ this video, we saw that in rotating frames, an apparent force pulling away from\
  \ the axis</span> <span m='857699'>of rotation is really the objects tendency to\
  \ move in a straight line.</span> <span m='863439'>In a rotating frame of reference,\
  \ objects require a centripetal acceleration to remain</span> <span m='868730'>stationary\
  \ in that frame.</span> <span m='871739'>Moving objects in rotating frames move\
  \ in curved paths due to the Coriolis acceleration,</span> <span m='877339'>created\
  \ by the fact that the velocity of points in the frame are greater further from\
  \ the</span> <span m='883449'>axis of rotation.</span> <span m='884819'>On Earth,\
  \ we can observe the Coriolis Effect in the counterclockwise rotation of hurricanes</span>\
  \ <span m='890989'>in the northern hemispheres.</span> <span m='893399'>This leaves\
  \ 2 questions for you. What direction do hurricanes rotate in the southern hemisphere?</span>\
  \ <span m='900529'>And why can't hurricanes form at the equator?</span> </p>"
