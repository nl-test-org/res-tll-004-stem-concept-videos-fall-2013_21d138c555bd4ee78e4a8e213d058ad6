Students are introduced to control volumes as a conceptual tool to aid in problem solving. Students use the concepts of mass conservation and control volumes to find unknown information in examples about a growing plant (photosynthesis) and a rusting car (iron oxidation). Learning Objectives After watching this video, students will be able to apply the law of conservation of mass to real-world scenarios.

Students gain an understanding of latent heat from the perspective of conservation of energy. Students learn about the use of phase change materials, materials that take advantage of the phenomena of latent heat, to heat and cool buildings. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Describe the energy transformations that occur during a phase change. Apply the law of conservation of energy to phase changes.
