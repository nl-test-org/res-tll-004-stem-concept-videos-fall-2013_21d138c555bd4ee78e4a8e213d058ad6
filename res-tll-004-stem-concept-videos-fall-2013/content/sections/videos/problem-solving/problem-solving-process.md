title: Problem Solving Process
transcript: "<p><span m='3240'> How do you design, test, and build a small and completely\
  \ edible boat that propels itself</span> <span m='9519'>through your cocktail? This\
  \ is a complicated problem, but it--and many other problems like</span> <span m='14830'>it--can\
  \ be solved systematically, by breaking the problem down into several key phases.</span>\
  \ <span m='19430'>In this video, we'll explore how two MIT graduate students created\
  \ these Cocktail Cruisers.</span> <span m='26609'>This video is part of the Problem\
  \ Solving video series.</span> <span m='29410'>Problem--solving skills, in combination\
  \ with an understanding of the natural and human-made</span> <span m='34260'>world,\
  \ are critical to the design and optimization of systems and processes.</span> <span\
  \ m='39010'>Hi, my name is Lisa Burton and I am Nadia Cheng. We are graduate students\
  \ in Peko Hosoi's</span> <span m='44640'>lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering\
  \ at MIT.</span> <span m='47800'>Today, we're going to tell you about a class project\
  \ that we worked on that turned into</span> <span m='52260'>a product called cocktail\
  \ cruisers.</span> <span m='54890'>After watching this video, you should be able\
  \ to identify the steps of the problem solving</span> <span m='59350'>process and\
  \ recognize that the problem solving process is iterative.</span> <span m='64459'>Take\
  \ a moment to think about your approach to problem solving. What steps do you generally</span>\
  \ <span m='69320'>go through?</span> <span m='71770'>Please pause the video and\
  \ take a moment to think about it. Then continue playing the</span> <span m='76140'>video\
  \ to hear about one approach. [PAUSE] While different people might approach a problem</span>\
  \ <span m='85700'>in different ways, using an explicit strategy for problem solving\
  \ can be very helpful. You</span> <span m='91899'>can find different problem solving\
  \ strategies in the literature. The strategy that we will</span> <span m='97210'>present\
  \ in this video is adapted from Don Woods and Philip Wankat.</span> <span m='102899'>The\
  \ first step is to define the problem. What are the criteria? What are the constraints?</span>\
  \ <span m='109740'>After defining the problem, you need to gather information. What\
  \ are the knowns and unknowns?</span> <span m='116219'>What content knowledge is\
  \ needed to solve the problem? Have others worked on a similar</span> <span m='120819'>problem\
  \ before?</span> <span m='121350'>The next step is to explore. Look at the problem\
  \ in different ways. Brainstorm different approaches</span> <span m='129669'>to\
  \ meeting the criteria given the constraints. After exploring, you need to pick\
  \ one approach</span> <span m='136610'>to solving your problem and plan your strategy.\
  \ Determine the resources needed to carryout</span> <span m='142640'>your plan.\
  \ A flowchart, outline, or schematic might be useful.</span> <span m='147829'>After\
  \ the planning phase, it is time to act. In this step, you follow your plan to create</span>\
  \ <span m='153560'>your solution.</span> <span m='156460'>Once you have a solution,\
  \ you need to check it. Does it make sense? Does it meet the criteria?</span> <span\
  \ m='162670'>Where does it fall short? Is any troubleshooting required? If the solution\
  \ isn't satisfactory,</span> <span m='168740'>it might be necessary to explore some\
  \ more and create a new plan.</span> <span m='174150'>Once you have your final solution,\
  \ what have you learned that you can generalize to other</span> <span m='178680'>contexts?</span>\
  \ <span m='180040'>Finally, disseminate your results so that others can learn from\
  \ your solution. This</span> <span m='185560'>could be through a class discussion,\
  \ a formal presentation, or a scientific paper.</span> <span m='191620'>Now that\
  \ you are familiar with the problem solving process, see if you can identify where</span>\
  \ <span m='195780'>I used these steps as I worked on a class project.</span> <span\
  \ m='199550'>This project began in my Fluid Dynamics class, which focused on interfacial\
  \ phenomena and</span> <span m='204200'>was taught by my other advisor, Professor\
  \ John Bush. The main criterion, or requirement,</span> <span m='209780'>for the\
  \ project was to conduct an experiment, perform a simulation, or design a product</span>\
  \ <span m='214920'>fundamentally based on a topic covered in class. There were also\
  \ some constraints placed</span> <span m='219790'>on the project. We only had three\
  \ months to work on it and a limited budget. Other than</span> <span m='224780'>that,\
  \ it was very open--ended.</span> <span m='226660'>It was really up to me to define\
  \ the problem from there. Learning about the Marangoni effect</span> <span m='231480'>inspired\
  \ my design. The Marangoni effect arises from a gradient, or difference, in surface</span>\
  \ <span m='236829'>tension.</span> <span m='237820'>We can see the Marangoni effect\
  \ by adding a drop of soap solution to a container of</span> <span m='242230'>water.\
  \ The soap solution reduces the surface tension of the water locally, causing flow.</span>\
  \ <span m='248740'>Using black pepper flakes as a tracer, we can visualize the flow\
  \ away from the area</span> <span m='252920'>of low surface tension.</span> <span\
  \ m='256410'>Surface tension is simply a property of liquid that results from intermolecular\
  \ forces. In</span> <span m='260849'>the bulk of a uniform liquid, each molecule\
  \ experiences a zero net force because molecules</span> <span m='266199'>that exert\
  \ equivalent force on each other surround it. At the surface of a liquid, molecules</span>\
  \ <span m='271430'>from the liquid experience a non-zero net force pulling them\
  \ toward the bulk of the</span> <span m='275879'>liquid because they are not completely\
  \ surrounded by like molecules. This causes the surface</span> <span m='280900'>to\
  \ minimize its area.</span> <span m='282680'>The high surface tension of water allows\
  \ objects denser than water, such as a paper clip or</span> <span m='287759'>a water\
  \ strider, to float on the surface.</span> <span m='290889'>If an object has a high\
  \ surface tension liquid on one side of it and a low surface tension</span> <span\
  \ m='295509'>liquid on the other side, the difference in surface tension will cause\
  \ the object to move</span> <span m='299669'>toward the high surface tension liquid.</span>\
  \ <span m='302370'>We can see that happen in this demonstration of a toothpick floating\
  \ on water. If we add</span> <span m='307330'>a few drops of soapy water to one\
  \ side of the toothpick, the toothpick moves away.</span> <span m='312360'>I decided\
  \ that I wanted to make a miniature boat that would be propelled by a surface</span>\
  \ <span m='316180'>tension gradient. I wanted to propel the boat in a water-based\
  \ environment, with the ultimate</span> <span m='321729'>goal of using it in a food\
  \ setting. This required that the second liquid be safe to eat since</span> <span\
  \ m='327960'>it would mix with the water. At this point, I wasn't concerned with\
  \ making the boat edible,</span> <span m='333539'>because it could simply be removed\
  \ by hand from the food.</span> <span m='336669'>Therefore, the problem we needed\
  \ to solve was how to design a boat that could be propelled</span> <span m='341590'>by\
  \ the Marangoni effect. This included the identification of a liquid that was edible</span>\
  \ <span m='346740'>and had the appropriate surface tension for use as the propellant.</span>\
  \ <span m='350419'>I started gathering information about different fluids that had\
  \ a lower surface tension than</span> <span m='355419'>water. I also looked at the\
  \ existing designs of other boats, noting what propellants they</span> <span m='360430'>used\
  \ and their method for releasing the propellant into the surrounding water.</span>\
  \ <span m='365219'>To identify important physical features of the boat, I did some\
  \ calculations, starting</span> <span m='369719'>with a simple force balance diagram.\
  \ We can represent the boat as a rectangular prism</span> <span m='374809'>for now.\
  \ Viewing the boat from the side, we see just a rectangle.</span> <span m='379529'>In\
  \ the vertical direction, the forces acting on the boat are the force due to gravity,</span>\
  \ <span m='383729'>or the weight of the boat, and the buoyancy force, which is equivalent\
  \ to the weight of</span> <span m='387729'>the water displaced by the boat and the\
  \ meniscus. You've probably noticed that water in your</span> <span m='393139'>drinking\
  \ glass slightly climbs up the wall of the glass. This is the meniscus and it</span>\
  \ <span m='397400'>depends on the material of the object (for instance, the boat\
  \ or the glass), the liquid,</span> <span m='402490'>and the gas (in our case air).\
  \ Therefore, to make the boat float, we must</span> <span m='407469'>ensure that\
  \ the weight of the water displaced balances the weight of the boat. This is Archimedes'</span>\
  \ <span m='412400'>principle.</span> <span m='413990'>In the horizontal direction,\
  \ we have the force of surface tension of the \"fuel\" on the left</span> <span\
  \ m='417719'>side and the force of surface tension of the surrounding fluid, which\
  \ we will assume is</span> <span m='422210'>water. If these forces aren't equal,\
  \ the boat must accelerate, according to Newton's Laws.</span> <span m='428349'>Therefore,\
  \ to make the boat move faster, we want the difference in surface tension to</span>\
  \ <span m='432430'>be as great as possible.</span> <span m='434919'>Once the boat\
  \ is moving, drag becomes important. Drag opposes the direction of motion and increases</span>\
  \ <span m='440520'>with velocity and the cross sectional area of the boat. A smaller\
  \ cross-sectional area</span> <span m='445839'>will allow the boat to move faster.</span>\
  \ <span m='448729'>To ensure that the boat remains stable, the center of mass must\
  \ be below the center of</span> <span m='453180'>buoyancy. Otherwise, the boat will\
  \ tip over and sink. As I explored different ideas, it</span> <span m='458460'>became\
  \ clear that I needed to do some testing.</span> <span m='461469'>To find an edible,\
  \ low surface tension liquid to act as the boat's fuel, I tested different</span>\
  \ <span m='466110'>liquids I found in my kitchen, from hot sauce to sugar water\
  \ to vinegar. From these tests,</span> <span m='471808'>I decided that I needed\
  \ a low surface tension liquid that was also volatile, or evaporative.</span> <span\
  \ m='477249'>This is necessary for the boat to continue to move; otherwise, the\
  \ fuel surrounds the</span> <span m='481539'>boat equally on all sides so that no\
  \ surface tension gradient exists and therefore the</span> <span m='486719'>boat\
  \ does not move.</span> <span m='488349'>The best fuel I found was liquor. The alcohol\
  \ content of the liquor and the surface tension</span> <span m='492849'>are inversely\
  \ related. Therefore, using a very high alcohol content liquor will result</span>\
  \ <span m='498259'>in a faster boat.</span> <span m='499969'>I started sketching\
  \ ideas for what the boats might look like. Drawing on previous research,</span>\
  \ <span m='504770'>the initial design had an open fuel reservoir in the middle of\
  \ the boat with a small slit</span> <span m='509529'>that allows the liquid to leave\
  \ the reservoir. The overall shape was a very simple boat shape.</span> <span m='515289'>After\
  \ testing materials for a while, it was time to come up with a plan. I decided that</span>\
  \ <span m='519849'>I needed to create a prototype so I enlisted the help of my lab\
  \ mate Nadia. She suggested</span> <span m='525350'>using a 3D printer to create\
  \ the boat in the Edgerton Center student shop.</span> <span m='530470'>The only\
  \ way we were really going to know if the boat design was going to work was to</span>\
  \ <span m='535060'>actually try it. It was time to act, and having rapid prototyping\
  \ technologies\u2014such as 3D</span> <span m='542440'>printers\u2014available significantly\
  \ expedites the testing and iteration process. The 3D</span> <span m='548170'>printer\
  \ requires that we develop 3D representations of our boat design in CAD. There are\
  \ various</span> <span m='554540'>types of 3D printing technologies; the one we\
  \ used utilizes fused-deposition modeling,</span> <span m='560860'>or FDM. The way\
  \ it works is that there is a spool of a thin plastic \"thread\" that is</span>\
  \ <span m='566600'>fed through a nozzle. The nozzle heats the plastic to soften\
  \ it so that the plastic can</span> <span m='572360'>be laid out to build a 3D object.\
  \ Basically, it is like piling a piece of string on top</span> <span m='578660'>of\
  \ itself to make a 3D shape. Because the boats needed to be less dense than the\
  \ liquids</span> <span m='584560'>they were to float on, we specified that the boats\
  \ were to be printed \"sparsely\", such</span> <span m='590050'>that the plastic\
  \ thread was to be laid out loosely whenever possible in the interior</span> <span\
  \ m='595110'>of the boats.</span> <span m='597209'>Once we had our boat, it was\
  \ time to check and see if it did want we wanted it to. Of</span> <span m='603250'>course,\
  \ our very first boat wasn't the ideal solution. The reservoir was too small and</span>\
  \ <span m='608790'>the boat was too large; it didn't hold enough fuel and moved\
  \ slowly because of the mass.</span> <span m='613180'>But it gave us insight into\
  \ what we needed to change. We modified our plan, created a</span> <span m='620660'>new\
  \ design, and tested it again. After some troubleshooting, we went through several\
  \ design</span> <span m='627970'>iterations. We examined many different boat designs\
  \ and liquors to use as fuel until we</span> <span m='633980'>had a design we were\
  \ happy with.</span> <span m='635829'>I presented my project to the class at the\
  \ end of course. I successfully stayed within</span> <span m='640870'>the design\
  \ and project constraints. I created a boat that used edible materials for propulsion</span>\
  \ <span m='646170'>through the Marangoni effect.</span> <span m='649690'>After completing\
  \ the course project, we continued to pursue this idea. We wanted to improve</span>\
  \ <span m='655730'>our design and also make the boat out of edible material so that\
  \ they could be used as a fun</span> <span m='661319'>garnish for drinks. This required\
  \ us to generalize our solution to a new situation. We constructed</span> <span\
  \ m='669389'>soft, flexible molds out of silicone by 3D printing rigid plastic molds\
  \ that the silicone</span> <span m='676110'>molds could be made from.</span> <span\
  \ m='678800'>After creating the molds, we tried several edible materials for the\
  \ boat including candy,</span> <span m='685279'>chocolate and marshmallows. We quickly\
  \ discovered that the density of the material was a common</span> <span m='691399'>limiting\
  \ factor.</span> <span m='693959'>After further testing, we found two materials\
  \ that worked: edible wax and gelatin, which</span> <span m='700750'>we foam as\
  \ it sets to reduce the density of the boat. We've since disseminated our product.</span>\
  \ <span m='706819'>I won a design award at a competition at MIT and we're currently\
  \ working with Chef Jose</span> <span m='711509'>Andres to incorporate our design\
  \ into his restaurant. Additionally, an article in the</span> <span m='716379'>American\
  \ Society for Engineering Education PRISM magazine helped spread our ideas and</span>\
  \ <span m='721420'>product to a broader audience.</span> <span m='724160'>To recap,\
  \ in order to solve this problem, we had to</span> <span m='728160'>define the problem\
  \ gather information</span> <span m='733220'>explore plan</span> <span m='735500'>act\
  \ and then check our solution</span> <span m='741240'>We were able to generalize\
  \ our solution to a new context and then disseminated our results.</span> <span\
  \ m='747319'>The problem solving process really helped us approach this problem\
  \ and break it down.</span> <span m='752100'>By consciously using a problem solving\
  \ process, you will find that you will become a more</span> <span m='757050'>confident\
  \ and better problem solver. Best of luck!</span> </p>"
