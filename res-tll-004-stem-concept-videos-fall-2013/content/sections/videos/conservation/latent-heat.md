title: Latent Heat
transcript: '<p><span m=''3600''>If you put water in the freezer, you''ll end up with
  ice. If you leave ice on your countertop,</span> <span m=''8709''>you''ll end up
  with liquid water. You''ve almost certainly seen these phase changes in your</span>
  <span m=''13119''>everyday experience. But there''s more to freezing and melting
  than meets the eye, and we can</span> <span m=''18230''>use these seemingly simple
  phenomena to make buildings significantly more energy efficient.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''22410''>In this video, we''ll explain the concept of "latent heat" and see how
  it can dramatically</span> <span m=''27480''>reduce heating and cooling costs in
  homes and skyscrapers alike.</span> </p><p><span m=''31980''>This video is part
  of the Conservation video series.</span> </p><p><span m=''34980''>In order to analyze
  or modify a system, it is important to understand how the laws of</span> <span m=''39329''>conservation
  place constraints on that system.</span> </p><p><span m=''42420''>Hi. My name is
  Stephen Ray and I am a graduate student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering</span>
  <span m=''47440''>at MIT. My research in the Building Technology Lab under the guidance
  of Professor Leon Glicksman</span> <span m=''53969''>focuses on energy efficient
  buildings.</span> </p><p><span m=''57079''>In order to understand the topic of this
  video, you should be familiar with the Law of Conservation</span> <span m=''61789''>of
  Energy. You should also be familiar with the effects of intermolecular forces on
  phase</span> <span m=''67719''>transitions.</span> </p><p><span m=''68710''>After
  watching this video, you should be able to describe the energy transformations that</span>
  <span m=''73750''>occur during a phase change and apply the law of conservation
  of energy to phase changes.</span> </p><p><span m=''80899''>Let''s start with a
  demonstration.</span> </p><p><span m=''83549''>Here we have a container of water
  to which we are adding table salt.</span> </p><p><span m=''88158''>Quite a bit of
  table salt, actually.</span> </p><p><span m=''91439''>Let''s stir that up.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''93090''>Next, we are going to crush up some ice to add to the salt
  water.</span> </p><p><span m=''98000''>Our goal is to lower the temperature of the
  ice bath.</span> </p><p><span m=''102219''>Let''s add some more salt.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''104210''>Freezing point depression, yeah!</span> </p><p><span m=''106579''>Alright,
  minus 8 degrees Celcius. That''s pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m=''111649''>Let''s
  place a smaller container of liquid water into this ice bath. We''ve added green</span>
  <span m=''116950''>food coloring to the water so that it is easier for you to see.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''121340''>After a few minutes, we''ll insert a thermometer and watch
  the temperature drop as the water</span> <span m=''125909''>is cooled by the ice
  bath.</span> </p><p><span m=''128410''>The temperature reads about -5 degrees Celsius.
  The green water is still a liquid even though</span> <span m=''133910''>the temperature
  is below the normal freezing point of water. This is called supercooling.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''139910''>In the next step of this demo, we are going to add a couple
  of small pieces of ice to</span> <span m=''144050''>the green water. The supercooled
  water will crystallize rapidly with the addition of the</span> <span m=''148579''>ice.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''150240''>When this happens, what do you predict will happen to
  the temperature on the thermometer?</span> </p><p><span m=''154200''>Will it increase,
  decrease, or stay the same?</span> </p><p><span m=''158990''>What reasoning supports
  your prediction? Pause the video here to discuss your ideas with</span> <span m=''163920''>the
  person beside you, then continue playing the video to see what happens.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''173100''>Okay, ready to see what happens? Be sure to keep your eye on the digital
  display.</span> </p><p><span m=''179170''>Now we''ll drop a couple of small pieces
  of ice into the container of green water.</span> </p><p><span m=''184840''>Watch
  what''s happening.</span> </p><p><span m=''187390''>The green water froze. There
  is still a little bit of liquid, but we can turn the container</span> <span m=''192700''>upside
  down and you can see that the ice remains inside.</span> </p><p><span m=''196900''>So,
  when the liquid froze, what happened to the temperature?</span> </p><p><span m=''202260''>The
  temperature went up! Is this what you predicted? How can we explain what happened?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''208920''>Well, let''s think about what happens at a molecular level
  when water changes phase from</span> <span m=''214010''>a liquid to a solid. In
  the liquid state, water molecules are moving around a lot. As</span> <span m=''221040''>it
  gets colder, the water molecules slow down.</span> </p><p><span m=''225210''>Generally
  speaking, as the water cools and solidifies, there is an increase in hydrogen</span>
  <span m=''230090''>bonding, the dominant intermolecular force amongst the water
  molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''235290''>With this hint, can you now explain
  why we observed a temperature increase when the water</span> <span m=''239680''>froze?
  Pause the video, take a moment to think about it on your own and then discuss your</span>
  <span m=''245730''>idea with a classmate. Then, continue playing the video for an
  explanation.</span> </p><p><span m=''256320''>As we said before, when water transitions
  from liquid to solid, there is an increase</span> <span m=''261040''>in the number
  of hydrogen bonds that are formed between water molecules. Does bond formation</span>
  <span m=''266500''>release energy or require energy?</span> </p><p><span m=''270740''>Bond
  formation releases energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''273880''>So then, is the process
  of ice forming exothermic or endothermic?</span> </p><p><span m=''279820''>Ice formation
  is exothermic.</span> </p><p><span m=''282790''>If we were to do an energy balance
  on the system and the surroundings, we would see</span> <span m=''286810''>that
  the energy that was released by the water freezing is equivalent to the thermal
  energy</span> <span m=''291820''>that caused the temperature to increase. This is
  the Law of Conservation of Energy.</span> </p><p><span m=''297930''>Generally speaking,
  when a substance transitions between phases, intermolecular forces between</span>
  <span m=''303540''>neighboring molecules are either formed or broken. When a substance
  transitions from</span> <span m=''308530''>a liquid to a solid, intermolecular forces,
  or bonds, are formed and energy is released</span> <span m=''314560''>to the surroundings.
  This is called the latent heat of fusion.</span> </p><p><span m=''320060''>Going
  in the other direction, when a substance transitions from a solid to a liquid, energy</span>
  <span m=''325260''>is required to overcome intermolecular forces, so this is an
  endothermic process. Energy</span> <span m=''331340''>is absorbed from the surroundings.
  This is called the latent heat of melting.</span> </p><p><span m=''337710''>The
  latent heat of melting is equivalent in magnitude to the latent heat of fusion,
  but</span> <span m=''342270''>opposite in sign.</span> </p><p><span m=''344659''>This
  phenomenon of latent heat is used in a variety of ways to heat and cool buildings.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''351680''>Using melting ice to absorb thermal energy from the surroundings
  saves some buildings</span> <span m=''356940''>thousands of dollars a year in cooling
  costs.</span> </p><p><span m=''360710''>Consider a large office building during
  the middle of a hot summer day. In order to keep</span> <span m=''365389''>the building
  comfortable, the air conditioning is running at full power, requiring a lot</span>
  <span m=''370169''>of electricity from the utility company. The utility companies
  can''t easily shut down their</span> <span m=''375340''>power plants, so nearly
  the same amount of electricity is produced during the night as</span> <span m=''380510''>is
  during the day. However, nighttime demand for electricity is very low, so utility
  companies</span> <span m=''387639''>sell this electricity at a lower price. This
  is common practice by utility companies across</span> <span m=''393620''>the U.S.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''396370''>Engineers have thought of a way to buy the electricity
  during the night when it is very</span> <span m=''400010''>cheap, but use it during
  the day when they need to run the air conditioning. This strategy</span> <span m=''406000''>is
  called peak load shifting. Think about what you have learned so far. There are a</span>
  <span m=''411580''>variety of ways this can be done. How do you think they do this?
  Pause the video here,</span> <span m=''418840''>take a moment to think about it,
  and discuss your idea with the person next to you. Continue</span> <span m=''424120''>playing
  the video to hear about one way they do this.</span> </p><p><span m=''433389''>One
  way we can decrease the amount of electricity needed in the daytime to cool a building
  is</span> <span m=''437990''>to use the energy storage capacity of ice, or its latent
  heat of melting.</span> </p><p><span m=''443650''>Large tanks, such as these in
  the basement of the Bank of America Tower in New York,</span> <span m=''448310''>store
  water that is frozen over night using cheap electricity. During the day, the ice</span>
  <span m=''453630''>melts and absorbs energy from the cooling fluid running through
  the building''s air conditioning</span> <span m=''458370''>system. Each of the tanks
  in the Bank of America building holds approximately 1600 gallons</span> <span m=''464740''>of
  water which translates to roughly 570 kilowatt hours of cooling capacity. Bank of
  America</span> <span m=''471720''>reports that these ice tanks supply 25% of their
  cooling energy annually.</span> </p><p><span m=''477919''>The desire to harness
  latent heat has led to the development of a class of materials</span> <span m=''482169''>called
  phase change materials. These materials have been specifically designed to change</span>
  <span m=''487740''>phase at desirable temperatures so that they can store and release
  energy in a way that</span> <span m=''492699''>is useful to consumers. This slide
  shows some examples of these materials. The materials</span> <span m=''499580''>on
  this slide fall into three classes of phase change materials: inorganic salt hydrates,</span>
  <span m=''506590''>paraffinic hydrocarbons, and organic fatty acids.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''511560''>Some ordinary building materials such as concrete, dry wall, or insulation
  have been specially</span> <span m=''517169''>engineered over the past 50 years
  to contain microscopic pellets of phase change materials.</span> </p><p><span m=''524149''>Cellulose
  insulation, shown here, is commonly used to insulate attics and walls. Researchers</span>
  <span m=''530600''>at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in the United States have
  impregnated small paraffin</span> <span m=''535410''>pellets in this common type
  of insulation to increase its performance.</span> </p><p><span m=''540879''>Because
  these pellets are microscopic, the phase change insulation looks exactly like</span>
  <span m=''545730''>the ordinary insulation to our naked eye. However, under a Scanning
  Electron Microscopic,</span> <span m=''552339''>the clusters of paraffinic pellets
  are easy to spot.</span> </p><p><span m=''556720''>Now lets look at the measured
  performance of a similar type of phase change insulation</span> <span m=''560899''>that
  is installed in a typical residential roof. The chart here shows the heat transfer</span>
  <span m=''566220''>into a house on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal
  axis. The two large black</span> <span m=''572959''>peaks, which occur during two
  consecutive summer days, correspond to the large amount</span> <span m=''578170''>of
  heat transfer into a home that a conventional roof allows. The smaller green peaks
  show</span> <span m=''584029''>how changing the roof surface material and venting
  the attic significantly help lower</span> <span m=''588819''>the heat transfer into
  a home by approximately 70%. This reduction in heat transfer leads</span> <span
  m=''595329''>to less energy required for cooling the home. The purple curve shows
  that if phase change</span> <span m=''600999''>insulation is used in addition to
  these roof modifications, we can reduce the required</span> <span m=''606459''>cooling
  energy by 90%!</span> </p><p><span m=''610559''>How does phase change insulation
  help save energy? Pause the video, take a moment to</span> <span m=''616509''>think
  about it, and share your thoughts with a classmate.</span> </p><p><span m=''626079''>Consider
  two homes with and without PCM roof insulation. Both homes are exposed to the</span>
  <span m=''632709''>same amount of solar energy from the sun. Although not all of
  that energy enters the</span> <span m=''637790''>home without PCM insulation, a
  significant portion is transferred through the roof into</span> <span m=''643230''>the
  house. The house with PCM insulation reduces this amount because some of the energy
  that</span> <span m=''649529''>would otherwise enter the house is used to melt the
  phase change material in the roof.</span> </p><p><span m=''655360''>In order for
  this effect to occur each day, the phase change material must solidify every</span>
  <span m=''660720''>night before it can melt again the next day.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''664649''>Let''s take a look at this chart of example phase change materials
  again. What phase change</span> <span m=''670439''>material would you use in a home
  or building in Singapore? Why? What additional information</span> <span m=''676459''>might
  you need to know to help make your decision? Pause the video here and discuss your
  choice</span> <span m=''682149''>with the person beside you.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''691790''>On average, year-round temperatures in Singapore hover between 23 and
  32 degrees Celcius. This</span> <span m=''698160''>is important when making our
  decision. Some of you may have selected the calcium chloride</span> <span m=''703490''>hydrate
  as a candidate phase change material because its melting temperature falls within</span>
  <span m=''708179''>the range of daytime high temperatures in Singapore. You may
  have selected octadecane</span> <span m=''713920''>for a similar reason. If you
  eliminated paraffin wax and palmitic acid, it was probably because</span> <span
  m=''720869''>their melting points are so much higher than the highest outdoor temperatures
  reached in</span> <span m=''725189''>the day. However, these phase change materials
  could be used on a conventional dark-colored</span> <span m=''731209''>roof where
  temperatures can exceed 70 C because of all the energy absorbed from the sun. Caprylic</span>
  <span m=''738369''>acid, on the other hand, has such a low melting temperature,
  that few, if any, building components</span> <span m=''744019''>would ever drop
  below this temperature.</span> </p><p><span m=''747019''>So, let''s go back to calcium
  chloride hydrate and octadecane. Both would melt and solidify</span> <span m=''753800''>within
  the temperature range of the environment, but octadecane has a higher heat of fusion,</span>
  <span m=''758839''>which leads to greater potential energy savings. While it is
  beyond the scope of this video,</span> <span m=''764239''>we also need to think
  about the heat transfer properties of the other building materials</span> <span
  m=''768220''>used in the roof and the cost and stability of the phase change materials.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''773329''>Today, you learned about the concept of latent heat and
  how the energy transformations that</span> <span m=''779019''>occur during a phase
  change are a consequence of the law of conservation of energy. You</span> <span
  m=''784769''>also saw how engineers have used the concept of latent heat to design
  phase change materials</span> <span m=''790379''>that can allow us to cool and heat
  homes more efficiently. The incorporation of phase change</span> <span m=''796610''>materials
  in building materials is still an active area of research. There are still engineering</span>
  <span m=''801739''>challenges to address, perhaps by you, in order to make these
  technologies cost-effective</span> <span m=''807220''>and more widely used.</span>
