transcript: '<p><span m=''2370''>82% of soldiers in battle suffer from traumatic limb
  injuries. Many of these injuries are</span> <span m=''8809''>large bone defects.
  Engineers at MIT are trying to create materials that mimic the function</span> <span
  m=''15750''>of the bone''s natural healing processes. The structure and properties
  of these materials</span> <span m=''20810''>promote bone regeneration. This video
  is part of the Structure-Function-Properties video</span> <span m=''27559''>series.
  The structure, function, and properties of a system are related and depend on the</span>
  <span m=''33079''>processes that define or create the system. Hi, my name is Nisarg
  Shah, and I am a graduate</span> <span m=''39679''>student in Professor Paula Hammond''s
  lab in the chemical engineering department at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m=''44820''>In
  the Hammond Lab, we design novel materials for tissue engineering, gene and drug
  delivery,</span> <span m=''49999''>and energy applications. My research in particular,
  focuses on developing and assembling different</span> <span m=''56010''>materials
  for bone tissue regeneration.</span> </p><p><span m=''59929''>Before watching this
  video, you should be familiar with the concepts of pH and pKa,</span> <span m=''65930''>and
  with the common chemical functional groups. After watching this video, you will
  be able</span> <span m=''71000''>to explain how the concepts of pH and pKa are useful
  in the design of materials via</span> <span m=''77280''>layer-by-layer assembly.
  Many of the materials our lab develops are based on a technique</span> <span m=''87390''>called
  layer-by-layer assembly. Layer- by-layer assembly utilizes electrostatic interactions</span>
  <span m=''93740''>to create layers of chemical species of alternating charge. These
  chemical species could be anything</span> <span m=''100530''>-- polymers, proteins,
  small molecules -- the key is that they have the appropriate positive</span> <span
  m=''107660''>or negative charge to incorporate them into the film.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''112039''>We assemble these films using a simple dip method. First, we take our
  substrate or surface</span> <span m=''118020''>that we wish to coat and bombard
  it with free radical oxygen in an instrument called a plasma</span> <span m=''123990''>cleaner.
  This not only cleans the surface of contaminants, but also leaves the surface</span>
  <span m=''130169''>with a negative charge. Next, we take our substrate and dip it
  into a solution of positively</span> <span m=''137519''>charged molecules. The molecules
  in solution bind to the substrate because of Coulombic</span> <span m=''144040''>interactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''145060''>This process is self-adsorption limited, meaning that
  once the newly adsorbed layer neutralizes</span> <span m=''151219''>the charged
  sites on the surface, additional molecules will not bind. This creates layers</span>
  <span m=''157359''>that are on the order of nanometers thick.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''160590''>After a rinse step to remove any unbound components, the substrate
  is dipped into a solution of</span> <span m=''167590''>negatively charged molecules.
  Interactions with the charges on the previous layer allow</span> <span m=''173510''>a
  new layer to be deposited. Again, we would rinse to remove any unbound components.
  We</span> <span m=''180329''>can continue this process and dip our growing film
  into solutions of positively and negatively</span> <span m=''185829''>charged molecules,
  with rinse steps in between, building up our coating layer-by-layer. Many</span>
  <span m=''193349''>of the films I work with have on the order of 40 layers. We use
  polymers in many of our</span> <span m=''199980''>layers. These long chain, high
  molecular weight molecules form more stable layers than small</span> <span m=''206620''>molecules.
  The long polymer chains from one layer weave through other layers creating</span>
  <span m=''211900''>an interlocking structure. Also, because we use negatively and
  positively charged polymers</span> <span m=''218819''>in these layers, the polymers
  ionically crosslink, adding to the stability of the overall film.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''227709''>Polymers whose repeating unit contains a charged group are called polyelectrolytes.
  Thus, many</span> <span m=''233430''>people refer to the films that we create as
  polyelectrolyte multilayers. For every polymer</span> <span m=''239150''>or small
  molecule I incorporate into my layer-by-layer assembly, I have to be mindful of
  it''s pKa</span> <span m=''246510''>and select appropriate assembly conditions to
  ensure they have the desired charge. For</span> <span m=''252889''>example, one
  of the polymers that I use in a layer-by-layer assembly is polyacrylic acid.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''258660''>You don''t need to worry about it''s exact chemical structure.
  The important thing to note is</span> <span m=''263620''>the repeating carboxylic
  acid group. Another polymer that I use in my layer-by-layer assembly</span> <span
  m=''269870''>contains repeating amine groups. Let''s say I''m creating my layer-by-layer
  assembly at</span> <span m=''275389''>a pH equal to 4. If the pKa of the carboxylic
  acid groups on our first polymer is approximately</span> <span m=''283470''>4.5,
  and the pKa of the amine groups on our second polymer is approximately 6.5, what</span>
  <span m=''291120''>would the charge on each of these polymers be? Pause the video
  and take a moment to think</span> <span m=''296330''>about it. At a pH of 4, some
  of the carboxylic acid groups on our first polymer would be</span> <span m=''308009''>deprotonated,
  resulting in a negative charge. At the same pH, some of the amine groups on</span>
  <span m=''314539''>our second polymer pick up an extra hydrogen, resulting in a
  positive charge. Because so</span> <span m=''326819''>many molecules could be viable
  candidates for incorporation into these films, they are</span> <span m=''331970''>being
  used in a wide variety of applications. My main interest is using these films in
  tissue</span> <span m=''338039''>engineering applications.</span> </p><p><span m=''339810''>So,
  first I have to ask myself, what problem do I want to solve? Then, I have to ask
  myself</span> <span m=''346060''>how these multilayer films could be useful. What
  function do they need to have? What properties</span> <span m=''352550''>of the
  film would help to achieve that function? Taking all of this into account, how should</span>
  <span m=''358000''>I structure my film?</span> </p><p><span m=''360409''>One of
  the problems I became particularly interested in is that of large bone defects.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''365770''>Large bone defects are large gaps in the bone that result
  from trauma.</span> </p><p><span m=''370479''>Although bone is capable of regeneration,
  when there are large defects, some sort of</span> <span m=''374860''>intervention
  therapy is needed to bridge the defect for proper healing.</span> </p><p><span m=''379639''>These
  intervention therapies typically involve taking bone tissue either from another
  location</span> <span m=''384389''>in the patient''s body or from a deceased donor
  source and grafting it into the defect site.</span> </p><p><span m=''391060''>While
  bone taken from the patient may be immune compatible and be more viable, this method</span>
  <span m=''396720''>has limitations. Tissue injury and trauma at the site of bone
  removal causes patients</span> <span m=''402729''>pain and long healing times. Bone
  tissue from a deceased donor may cause an unfavorable</span> <span m=''408650''>immune
  response. The processes used to prepare these tissues for implantation may also
  compromise</span> <span m=''415490''>their mechanical properties.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''417219''>Our lab had an idea for a possible solution to this problem. We asked
  ourselves, can we</span> <span m=''420949''>design a scaffold to bridge these large
  defects that will stimulate the growth of new bone</span> <span m=''421800''>tissue?
  The idea was to create a rigid, porous scaffold coated with a multilayer film. The</span>
  <span m=''426979''>multilayer film would deliver biological molecules that would
  stimulate the growth of bone both</span> <span m=''432530''>on the surface and throughout
  the scaffold. Over time, the scaffold would slowly degrade,</span> <span m=''438060''>leaving
  the new bone tissue behind. In selecting components for both the scaffold and these</span>
  <span m=''444300''>films, we looked to the biological process of wound healing for
  inspiration. The idea</span> <span m=''450610''>was that if we could mimic the wound
  healing process in bone, we could potentially regenerate</span> <span m=''455530''>tissue
  that is mechanically and chemically identical to native bone tissue.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''461229''>The bulk of our scaffold consisted of a polymer that would slowly degrade
  when placed in the</span> <span m=''466770''>body. This polymer was mixed with calcium
  phosphate, a significant component of native</span> <span m=''472610''>bone. Our
  thought was that calcium phosphate would promote the attachment, growth, and</span>
  <span m=''478610''>migration of cells that produce bone tissue within the scaffold.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''482840''>We then used layer-by-layer assembly to create a multilayered
  film on the surface of the</span> <span m=''487289''>scaffold. The film contained
  layers of polymers and layers of biological molecules that we</span> <span m=''493560''>wanted
  to release into the defect site. One of the molecules was a protein called bone</span>
  <span m=''499240''>morphogenetic protein-2. This protein is a growth factor that
  stimulates mesenchymal</span> <span m=''504749''>stem cells from the bone marrow
  to transform into bone tissue producing cells.</span> </p><p><span m=''510479''>The
  biodegradable properties of the polymers we used in the film would help to release</span>
  <span m=''515000''>the protein into the surrounding tissue when the scaffold is
  implanted.</span> </p><p><span m=''519570''>In addition to identifying molecules
  that would give us the function and properties</span> <span m=''523510''>that we
  desired, we had to choose an assembly pH that would ensure they had the desired</span>
  <span m=''529980''>charge.</span> </p><p><span m=''535180''>To test our hypothesis
  that these materials would lead to bone growth, we implanted our</span> <span m=''540540''>coated
  scaffold into a rat quadriceps muscle.</span> </p><p><span m=''544440''>In this
  model, the scaffold was placed in a location where bone is not normally found,</span>
  <span m=''549639''>so that we would know that any bone created on the scaffold was
  due to the coating.</span> </p><p><span m=''555180''>Our experiments were successful
  in that we saw the deposition of bone minerals and collagen</span> <span m=''560750''>on
  our scaffolds within 4 weeks. Of course, there are more experiments to be done to
  see</span> <span m=''566800''>if this system will work in the same way in a large
  defect site.</span> </p><p><span m=''571550''>The main lesson I learned in these
  experiments was that for bone tissue regeneration to occur,</span> <span m=''576829''>my
  multilayer-coated scaffolds needed to provide two key functions: to encourage bone
  producing</span> <span m=''583450''>cells to attach, migrate through, and deposit
  tissue in the scaffold; and to encourage mesenchymal</span> <span m=''591760''>stem
  cells to transform into bone producing cells.</span> </p><p><span m=''601290''>In
  this video, we hope that you saw how general chemistry concepts such as pH and pKa
  continue</span> <span m=''616990''>to be useful beyond the classroom and into research
  settings. Here, we saw how we need</span> <span m=''622060''>We also saw how considering
  the desired function and properties of a material can help us rationally</span>
  <span m=''628440''>design its structure.</span> </p>'
