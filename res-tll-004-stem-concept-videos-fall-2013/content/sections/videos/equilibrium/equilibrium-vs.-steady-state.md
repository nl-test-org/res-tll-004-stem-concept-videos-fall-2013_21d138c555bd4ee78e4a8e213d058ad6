about_this_resource_text: '<h2 class="subhead">Summary</h2> <p>In this video, viewers
  explore the differences and similarities between thermal equilibrium and steady
  state temperature. Four scenarios are presented wherein the heat transfer between
  a pan and its handle, and between the handle and the room are constrained in a variety
  of ways, and the resultant temperature profiles are discussed. Viewers are asked
  to: determine whether the handle is at thermal equilibrium or steady state temperature;
  sketch a corresponding temperature profile in the pan-handle; and predict whether
  or not a particular pan-handle will be cool enough to touch.</p> <h2 class="subhead">Learning

title: Equilibrium vs. Steady State
transcript: "<p><span m='5220'> Here's a pan on a stove top. The pan's body and handle\
  \ are made out of the same material.</span> <span m='11450'>The burner has been\
  \ turned on for a little while, and the pan body is hot enough to cook</span> <span\
  \ m='15139'>this egg. But what about the handle? Is it too hot to touch? Or is it\
  \ cool enough to</span> <span m='20730'>hold? Let's find out.</span> <span m='24759'>This\
  \ video is part of the Equilibrium video series. It is often important to determine</span>\
  \ <span m='29529'>whether or not a system is at equilibrium, to do this we must\
  \ understand how a system's</span> <span m='34060'>equilibrium state is constrained\
  \ by its boundary and surroundings.</span> <span m='38660'>Hi, my name is John Lienhard,\
  \ and I am a professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.</span> <span m='44620'>Today,\
  \ I am going to talk to you about Equilibrium and Steady State. It's a common misconception</span>\
  \ <span m='51310'>that Equilibrium and Steady State are the same. In this video,\
  \ we'll take a closer look</span> <span m='56540'>at these concepts and see how\
  \ they differ. In order to understand this video, you should</span> <span m='62690'>be\
  \ familiar with the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics, the meaning of thermal</span>\
  \ <span m='66970'>equilibrium, and the concept of heat flow rate, which is heat\
  \ transfer per unit time.</span> <span m='73800'>After watching this video, you\
  \ will be able to identify whether a system is at equilibrium</span> <span m='77960'>or\
  \ at steady state, and to describe the difference between Thermal Equilibrium and\
  \ Steady State.</span> <span m='89350'>This metal bar has been sitting in a large\
  \ room for a long period of time. In this example,</span> <span m='94780'>we can\
  \ assume that the room, which acts as the surroundings, is very large, much larger</span>\
  \ <span m='99190'>than the bar, which acts as our system. Heat transfer from the\
  \ bar to the room acts as</span> <span m='105250'>energy transfer across the system\
  \ boundary. We'll assume that the volume of the bar and</span> <span m='110710'>pressure\
  \ of the room are constant. In other words, no mechanical work is done.</span> <span\
  \ m='117658'>The temperature of the bar is 25\xB0C and the temperature of the room\
  \ is also 25\xB0C. Even</span> <span m='125310'>though the molecules in the air\
  \ are colliding with the atoms on the surface of the bar,</span> <span m='129449'>there\
  \ is no net transfer of energy between the room and the bar. The temperature of\
  \ both</span> <span m='134700'>the bar and the room remain constant at 25\xB0C.\
  \ In thermodynamic terms, we say that the bar</span> <span m='142450'>and the room\
  \ are in thermal equilibrium. Because there is no difference in temperature,</span>\
  \ <span m='149480'>there is no heat transfer between the bar and the room. What\
  \ if we wanted the temperature</span> <span m='155290'>of the bar to be larger than\
  \ that of the room, and we wanted it to remain that way? Pause</span> <span m='160230'>the\
  \ video and think about how we might do this.</span> <span m='170610'>Of course,\
  \ if we simply place a bar at 45\xB0C in the room, the small bar will lose energy</span>\
  \ <span m='177170'>to the large room until both the bar and room are once again\
  \ at thermal equilibrium at a</span> <span m='182440'>temperature approximately\
  \ equal to but ever so slightly higher than 25\xB0C.</span> <span m='190800'>You\
  \ might have suggested connecting some sort of heating element to the bar. Let's\
  \ try this</span> <span m='195690'>and see what happens. Here's the bar after it\
  \ has been left on a heater for a long time.</span> <span m='202569'>As you might\
  \ have expected, the bar is hottest where it's touching the heater, and coolest</span>\
  \ <span m='207030'>at the opposite end. There is a temperature gradient between\
  \ these two points, but this</span> <span m='212319'>gradient doesn't change over\
  \ time. In this case, would you say the bar is at</span> <span m='217920'>thermal\
  \ equilibrium with the room? Why or why not? Pause the video here and discuss</span>\
  \ <span m='223329'>this with a partner. We know that energy is being continuously</span>\
  \ <span m='234440'>transferred from the heater to the metal bar. And we also know\
  \ that the temperature profile</span> <span m='239400'>of the bar is not changing;\
  \ in other words, it's not getting any hotter or cooler. That</span> <span m='245959'>means\
  \ the bar must be transferring the energy it's gaining from the heater to the air\
  \ in</span> <span m='250459'>the room. And that means it cannot be in thermal equilibrium\
  \ with the room.</span> <span m='257060'>Now, in order for the temperature profile\
  \ to be constant in time, the heat flow rate</span> <span m='263060'>from the heater\
  \ into the bar must be constant and equal to the heat flow rate from the bar</span>\
  \ <span m='268970'>to the room. We could use a new term to describe these conditions\
  \ -- we could say that the</span> <span m='275240'>bar is at steady state. A quantity\
  \ is at Steady State when it is constant</span> <span m='282050'>with respect to\
  \ time. In other words, the partial derivative of the quantity with respect</span>\
  \ <span m='287870'>to time is zero. The metal bar is at steady state because the\
  \ time derivative of its temperature</span> <span m='294310'>at any point is zero.\
  \ This happens when the heat flow rate into the bar and out of the</span> <span\
  \ m='299870'>bar are equal and constant.</span> <span m='307320'>Let's go back to\
  \ the heated pan which was left on the stove for a long time. Do you</span> <span\
  \ m='311750'>think the pan handle will be too hot to touch, or cool enough to hold?</span>\
  \ <span m='317160'>Use the concepts of thermal equilibrium and steady state temperature\
  \ to think of circumstances</span> <span m='321550'>in which the handle might be\
  \ too hot, or cool enough, to hold. You might consider how the</span> <span m='327340'>handle\
  \ is attached to the pan, or how well the handle transfers heat to the room. Pause</span>\
  \ <span m='332880'>the video here and discuss.</span> <span m='342570'>How many\
  \ scenarios did you come up with? There are many, but let's start with two extreme</span>\
  \ <span m='347630'>cases.</span> <span m='349500'>What would happen if the handle\
  \ and pan were in perfect thermal contact, and both were</span> <span m='353680'>completely\
  \ isolated from the room? Eventually, the handle would reach the same temperature</span>\
  \ <span m='359270'>as the pan. This is what that would look like: the temperature\
  \ of the pan and handle are</span> <span m='364610'>identical and constant. So,\
  \ the handle is in thermal equilibrium with the pan. What</span> <span m='372919'>can\
  \ you say about the transfer of heat from the pan to the handle once the pan and\
  \ handle</span> <span m='377100'>are in this situation? Pause the video and discuss.\
  \ The rate of heat transfer must be</span> <span m='390880'>zero -- if it wasn't,\
  \ the handle would keep getting hotter, which is impossible, assuming</span> <span\
  \ m='396250'>that the temperature of the pan is constant. The heat flow rate from\
  \ the handle to the</span> <span m='401150'>room is also zero, because we assumed\
  \ the handle is isolated from the room.</span> <span m='407530'>So, the heat flow\
  \ rates into and out of the handle are exactly the same - zero and constant.</span>\
  \ <span m='416479'>And steady state occurs when the flow rate in equals the flow\
  \ rate out, even if they're</span> <span m='420919'>both zero. So this scenario,\
  \ which we've been describing as \"equilibrium,\" is really just</span> <span m='428819'>a\
  \ limiting case of steady state. And that's true for all systems at thermal equilibrium:</span>\
  \ <span m='434699'>they are all at steady state with respect to temperature. But\
  \ the opposite is not true:</span> <span m='441389'>not all systems at steady state\
  \ are in thermal equilibrium. In this case, the handle will</span> <span m='447270'>obviously\
  \ be too hot to hold, since it's the same temperature as the pan.</span> <span m='453169'>Now\
  \ let's consider the opposite case. What would happen if the handle were completely</span>\
  \ <span m='458199'>insulated from the pan? The handle would be at thermal equilibrium\
  \ with the room, and</span> <span m='464909'>would stay that way no matter how hot\
  \ the pan got. The temperature of the handle would</span> <span m='469849'>be exactly\
  \ the same as that of the air. Just as in our first case, both the heat flow rate</span>\
  \ <span m='478099'>from the pan to the handle and from the handle to the air are\
  \ zero and constant. Thus, this</span> <span m='484520'>case of \"thermal equilibrium\"\
  \ is really just another limiting case of steady-state temperature,</span> <span\
  \ m='489910'>except, of course, the handle will be cool enough to hold. Both of\
  \ these cases are great</span> <span m='496349'>thought experiments. But they could\
  \ never happen in real life, because it's impossible</span> <span m='501030'>to\
  \ completely isolate one component of a system from another. In case 1, it would\
  \ be impossible</span> <span m='507160'>to isolate the pan and handle from the room;\
  \ and in case 2, it would be impossible to isolate</span> <span m='513179'>the handle\
  \ from the pan. So are we any closer to figuring out whether we can pick up this</span>\
  \ <span m='518219'>pan or not? Let's keep going...</span> <span m='522499'>Let's\
  \ go back to our first case and refine our thinking. We originally assumed that\
  \ the</span> <span m='527319'>pan and handle were in perfect thermal contact, and\
  \ that the pan and handle were totally isolated</span> <span m='532670'>from the\
  \ room. Let's keep the first assumption, but change the second assumption. In other</span>\
  \ <span m='539209'>words, we will allow for some flow of heat from the handle to\
  \ the room. Now what happens</span> <span m='545850'>as we heat up the pan? We can\
  \ assume that the heat flow rate from the pan to the handle</span> <span m='551019'>is\
  \ initially larger than the heat flow rate from the handle to the room. This is\
  \ reasonable</span> <span m='556899'>because the pan is initially much hotter than\
  \ the handle.</span> <span m='561459'>So the handle will definitely heat up, just\
  \ like our metal bar from before. As long as</span> <span m='567489'>the flow of\
  \ heat from the pan to the handle is greater than the flow of heat from the</span>\
  \ <span m='570899'>handle to the room, the handle will get hotter. And also just\
  \ like our metal bar, it will</span> <span m='577050'>be hottest closest to the\
  \ pan, and coolest far away from it.</span> <span m='582509'>As the temperature\
  \ of the handle rises, the heat flow rate from the handle to the room</span> <span\
  \ m='586699'>will also rise. And eventually, it will equal the heat flow rate from\
  \ the pan to the handle.</span> <span m='593480'>In other words, after some length\
  \ of time the handle will be losing energy to the room</span> <span m='598050'>at\
  \ exactly the same rate as it's gaining energy from the pan. When this happens,\
  \ the temperature</span> <span m='605199'>gradient along the handle will stop changing,\
  \ and the system will be at steady state with</span> <span m='610379'>respect to\
  \ temperature. But, remember: it will not be in thermal equilibrium. So, can</span>\
  \ <span m='619369'>we say whether the handle is too hot to hold? No! That depends\
  \ on the exact temperature</span> <span m='625329'>distribution when the system\
  \ reaches steady state. Take a moment to sketch a temperature</span> <span m='630779'>profile\
  \ that describes a steady-state situation wherein all or part of the handle is too\
  \ hot</span> <span m='636449'>to touch. What values of the heat flow rate from the\
  \ pan to the handle could result in</span> <span m='643470'>a handle that is too\
  \ hot to touch. What characteristics of the pan, handle and/or room could produce</span>\
  \ <span m='649350'>this profile? Pause the video and discuss this with a partner.</span>\
  \ <span m='658269'>Okay, we're at our final scenario. Let's review the previous\
  \ cases.</span> <span m='668309'>In case 1, we assumed the pan and handle were in\
  \ perfect thermal contact and that the system</span> <span m='673689'>was completely\
  \ isolated from the room. In case 2, the handle was completely isolated</span> <span\
  \ m='679459'>from the pan.</span> <span m='681559'>In both case 1 and case 2, the\
  \ handle was in thermal equilibrium -- there was no transfer</span> <span m='687049'>of\
  \ heat into or out of the system. The handle was also at steady state with respect\
  \ to temperature.</span> <span m='692709'>Make sure that you can explain why this\
  \ is true.</span> <span m='697100'>In case 3, we went back to our assumption of\
  \ perfect thermal contact between the pan</span> <span m='701249'>and the handle,\
  \ but we allowed for some heat transfer from the handle to the room. For</span>\
  \ <span m='708009'>this final case, let's pick and choose the most reasonable assumptions\
  \ from our previous</span> <span m='712999'>cases and build from there. We'll assume\
  \ that the handle can exchange heat with the room.</span> <span m='718689'>We'll\
  \ also assume that the pan and handle are insulated from each other. This is reasonable,</span>\
  \ <span m='724970'>because if you're a pan designer, you don't want your customers\
  \ burning their hands! But</span> <span m='731220'>of course, there is no such thing\
  \ as perfect insulation, so we have to allow for at least</span> <span m='737029'>some\
  \ heat transfer between the pan and handle. If the rate of heat flow from the pan\
  \ to the</span> <span m='743139'>handle is extremely small, what can you say about\
  \ the temperature profile across the handle</span> <span m='748170'>once the system\
  \ reaches steady state? Pause the video and sketch a possible steady state</span>\
  \ <span m='753949'>temperature profile in the handle.</span> <span m='757470'>Here's\
  \ one. If the rate of heat flow from the pan to the handle is very low, the system</span>\
  \ <span m='766279'>will reach a steady state temperature well before the majority\
  \ of the handle gets hot.</span> <span m='771959'>There will be a very small region\
  \ near the pan where the handle is hotter than the room,</span> <span m='776739'>but\
  \ most of the handle will be close to the temperature of the room. So let's answer\
  \ our</span> <span m='783420'>original question. Will the pan handle be too hot\
  \ to hold or will it be comfortable</span> <span m='788569'>to touch? Let's look\
  \ at a thermal image of the pan after it has been left on the stove</span> <span\
  \ m='794949'>for 30 minutes. It looks like we predicted in case 4! A very small\
  \ portion of the handle</span> <span m='801949'>is warmer than the room, but most\
  \ of the handle is at room temperature. Remember, this does</span> <span m='808389'>not\
  \ mean that the handle is in thermal equilibrium with the room. There is a constant\
  \ but small</span> <span m='813929'>rate of heat flow from the pan to the handle,\
  \ and an equal rate of heat flow from the handle</span> <span m='819239'>to the\
  \ room.</span> <span m='821259'>The handle was designed to reach a steady-state\
  \ temperature that is comfortable to hold without</span> <span m='825109'>a glove.\
  \ This is a well-designed pan!</span> <span m='833589'>You now have the tools to\
  \ understand that Thermal Equilibrium and Steady State temperature</span> <span\
  \ m='837989'>are different. We saw that if the temperatures of all parts of a system\
  \ do not change with</span> <span m='843589'>time, the system can either be at steady\
  \ state or at thermal equilibrium. If the net heat</span> <span m='850199'>flow\
  \ is constant and nonzero as for our metal bar on the heater, the system will have\
  \ a</span> <span m='855790'>steady temperature profile. If it is constant and zero,\
  \ as for our metal bar at room temperature,</span> <span m='862839'>the system is\
  \ at thermal equilibrium. So, equilibrium is just a special case of steady</span>\
  \ <span m='869569'>state. We were able to apply our understanding of thermal equilibrium\
  \ and steady state temperature</span> <span m='875889'>to describe the temperature\
  \ profile of a pan left on the stove for a long time and to understand</span> <span\
  \ m='881499'>the design elements that led to that profile. I hope you enjoyed this\
  \ video.</span> <span m='888339'>Good luck in your studies.</span> </p>"
