title: Feedback Loops
transcript: "<p><span m='8410'> Soon after a meal, your digestive system breaks down\
  \ the food you have eaten into a simple</span> <span m='12750'>sugar called glucose.\
  \ Glucose is absorbed from the gut into the bloodstream, causing</span> <span m='17439'>your\
  \ blood sugar level to increase. In healthy individuals, feedback mechanisms in\
  \ the body</span> <span m='22689'>bring blood sugar levels back to normal. In some\
  \ people, this process breaks down, resulting</span> <span m='27990'>in diabetes.</span>\
  \ <span m='29840'>In this video, we'll take a closer look at feedback loops, how\
  \ they tie into the body's</span> <span m='33860'>mechanism of internal regulation,\
  \ and what happens when these mechanisms fail.</span> <span m='39390'>This video\
  \ is part of the Information Flow series. A system is shaped and changed by</span>\
  \ <span m='44399'>the nature and flow of information into, within, and out of the\
  \ system.</span> <span m='48579'>Hi, my name is Leah Okumura and I am a Technical\
  \ Instructor in the Biology Department at MIT.</span> <span m='54930'>Before watching\
  \ this video, you should be familiar with the concept that your body is</span> <span\
  \ m='58370'>a tightly regulated environment. After watching this video, you will\
  \ be able identify the</span> <span m='63399'>general components of a feedback loop,\
  \ examples of negative and positive feedback loops in</span> <span m='68020'>the\
  \ body, and describe how feedback loops are vital to healthy function and survival.</span>\
  \ <span m='77160'>Our bodies rely heavily on feedback loops to control and regulate\
  \ important biochemical</span> <span m='81440'>and physiological functions.</span>\
  \ <span m='83160'>There are two types of feedback loops in biology: negative feedback\
  \ loops, and positive feedback</span> <span m='88500'>loops. These act to either\
  \ reduce or amplify the changes that occur in a given system.</span> <span m='94110'>Let's\
  \ see how feedback loops can be applied to thermoregulation. Imagine walking into</span>\
  \ <span m='99110'>a room that has an air conditioner on at full blast. After a few\
  \ minutes, you find yourself</span> <span m='103800'>shivering from the cold. Does\
  \ the shivering serve a purpose? Yes! The rapid muscle contractions</span> <span\
  \ m='109420'>from shivering generate heat within the body and warm you back up.\
  \ Now imagine taking a</span> <span m='116670'>walk outside on a very hot and sunny\
  \ day. After a few minutes under the hot sun, you</span> <span m='121720'>are perspiring\
  \ profusely. What purpose does sweating serve? As sweat evaporates from your</span>\
  \ <span m='127479'>skin, it helps to cool you down.</span> <span m='132590'>Thermoregulation\
  \ serves to control our body's temperature much like a thermostat regulating</span>\
  \ <span m='135970'>the temperature of a room. From this diagram, you can see how\
  \ thermoregulation follows a</span> <span m='140900'>simple loop. Because the response\
  \ in this case is always to reverse a given change in</span> <span m='145710'>body\
  \ temperature, we call this a negative feedback loop. Positive feedback loops are</span>\
  \ <span m='150840'>just the opposite. When a change occurs in a system, a positive\
  \ feedback loop acts to</span> <span m='155360'>increase or exacerbate it. Labor\
  \ preceding childbirth is a classic example of a positive</span> <span m='160760'>feedback\
  \ loop. Contractions of the uterus during childbirth stimulate the release of</span>\
  \ <span m='165190'>a hormone, oxytocin, which in turn induces more uterine contractions.\
  \ The self-amplifying</span> <span m='170970'>nature of the positive feedback loop\
  \ is repeated over and over with increasing intensity until</span> <span m='175760'>the\
  \ baby is born. After birth, contractions stop and the feedback loop ceases. Here\
  \ are</span> <span m='182180'>a few well-known physiological processes and parameters\
  \ that involve feedback loops. Pause</span> <span m='187370'>the video here and\
  \ determine which ones involve negative feedback and which ones involve positive</span>\
  \ <span m='192010'>feedback.</span> <span m='198180'>Negative feedback loops minimize\
  \ deviations within a system, keeping its parameters close</span> <span m='202350'>to\
  \ a desired set-point. The control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and breathing\
  \ rates</span> <span m='207790'>rely heavily on negative feedback loops.</span>\
  \ <span m='211650'>Positive feedback loops, on the other hand, tend to destabilize\
  \ a system by amplifying</span> <span m='215450'>a stimulus towards an extreme.\
  \ This is important in irreversible processes such as action potential</span> <span\
  \ m='221600'>generation, blood clotting, lactation, and ovulation.</span> <span\
  \ m='225560'>There are many other examples of negative and positive feedback loops\
  \ in the human body.</span> <span m='237030'>Now let's take a closer look at specific\
  \ components involved in a feedback loop.</span> <span m='241540'>The receptor is\
  \ the component that detects and measures changes in a given parameter.</span> <span\
  \ m='246310'>The receptor then relays this information to a control center. The\
  \ control center compares</span> <span m='252910'>the measured parameter to a desired\
  \ set point. Based on the extent of deviation, the control</span> <span m='258259'>center\
  \ decides on the appropriate response and sends signals to an effector. Effectors</span>\
  \ <span m='264710'>can be muscles, organs, or any other component that receives\
  \ signals from the control center.</span> <span m='270120'>In response to these\
  \ signals, the effectors can either enhance or reduce the deviation.</span> <span\
  \ m='276990'>If the deviation is enhanced, we have a positive feedback loop. And\
  \ if it is reduced, we have</span> <span m='282770'>a negative feedback loop. Now\
  \ let's go back to our thermoregulation example in greater</span> <span m='293940'>detail.\
  \ Here, the parameter we are controlling is internal body temperature. The receptors</span>\
  \ <span m='300860'>of temperature in our body are specialized cells called thermoreceptors.\
  \ Thermoreceptors</span> <span m='305970'>continually monitor our temperature and\
  \ pass this information to the control center in</span> <span m='310020'>the brain,\
  \ called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus compares the measured temperatures to\
  \ the</span> <span m='315340'>set point of 37 \u1D52C. It can distinguish temperature\
  \ differences as small as a hundredth of a degree!</span> <span m='322600'>The hypothalamus\
  \ then sends out signals to effectors in the body to initiate corrective</span>\
  \ <span m='327220'>mechanisms when our temperatures are too high or too low. The\
  \ effectors react accordingly</span> <span m='330880'>to adjust our body temperature.\
  \ When we are too hot, signals are sent to activate our</span> <span m='334250'>sweat\
  \ glands. Blood vessels in the skin are also stimulated to dilate. These changes\
  \ increase</span> <span m='339740'>heat loss from the skin. When we are too cold,\
  \ signals are sent to the tissues to increase</span> <span m='345480'>metabolism,\
  \ and to the muscles to induce shivering. These mechanisms generate heat. Signals\
  \ are</span> <span m='351389'>also sent to constrict blood vessels and to raise\
  \ skin hairs to minimize heat loss.</span> <span m='361820'>Both negative and positive\
  \ feedback loops are equally important for the healthy functioning</span> <span\
  \ m='365520'>of one's body. Complications can arise from failure of these mechanisms.</span>\
  \ <span m='370520'>Let's look at blood glucose regulation, and see what happens\
  \ if the feedback mechanisms</span> <span m='374199'>do not work as they should.\
  \ Glucose is the primary source of energy for the body's cells.</span> <span m='380340'>Thus,\
  \ in a healthy individual, glucose levels are tightly regulated to maintain a fairly</span>\
  \ <span m='385430'>constant and optimal supply in the bloodstream. Too little or\
  \ too much blood glucose could</span> <span m='390479'>be damaging to the body.\
  \ Circulating levels of glucose are monitored by specialized beta</span> <span m='395949'>cells\
  \ in islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. In response to high glucose levels, for\
  \ example</span> <span m='401850'>after a large meal, these same beta cells release\
  \ a hormone called insulin into the</span> <span m='406430'>bloodstream. Insulin\
  \ is transported to the rest of the body, whereupon it stimulates</span> <span m='411510'>the\
  \ cells to take up and adsorb glucose. Insulin also promotes the storage of glucose\
  \ in muscle</span> <span m='417690'>and liver tissues. These actions act to remove\
  \ glucose from the blood, thus lowering blood</span> <span m='424050'>glucose levels\
  \ to the normal set-point. Blood glucose regulation is a classic example of</span>\
  \ <span m='429830'>negative feedback. Pause the video and identify the receptor,\
  \ control center, and effectors</span> <span m='435080'>in this particular feedback\
  \ system.</span> <span m='444310'>The receptors are the beta cells in the pancreas.\
  \ These same cells also act as the control center</span> <span m='449550'>and send\
  \ signals to the effectors in the form of insulin. The effectors are the cells of</span>\
  \ <span m='454880'>the body that increase their uptake and storage of glucose in\
  \ response to insulin. Now let's</span> <span m='461990'>see how failure of the\
  \ body to regulate blood glucose levels results in a disease known</span> <span\
  \ m='466360'>as diabetes. There are two common forms of the disease.</span> <span\
  \ m='472100'>In Type I diabetes, also known as early-onset diabetes, the insulin-producing\
  \ beta cells</span> <span m='477490'>of the pancreas are destroyed due to an autoimmune\
  \ reaction. In this form of diabetes, the body</span> <span m='483180'>is unable\
  \ to produce insulin. The lack of insulin means that the cells of the body do</span>\
  \ <span m='489289'>not take up glucose in response to increasing glucose levels.\
  \ Hence, glucose levels in the</span> <span m='494270'>blood continue to rise. In\
  \ Type II diabetes, or late-onset diabetes, insulin is still produced</span> <span\
  \ m='502080'>but the body's cells no longer respond to it. This is often due to\
  \ years of insulin</span> <span m='506930'>over-production, caused by a high-sugar\
  \ diet. The inability of cells to use insulin properly</span> <span m='513198'>means\
  \ that high glucose levels in the blood persist with time. Type I and Type II diabetes</span>\
  \ <span m='520120'>have very similar symptoms but they arise from different causes.\
  \ Pause the video and</span> <span m='525019'>identify the parts of the feedback\
  \ loop that break down in each.</span> <span m='535050'>In Type I diabetes, there\
  \ is a lack of signaling between the control center and the effectors.</span> <span\
  \ m='540649'>In Type II diabetes, the effectors fail to respond to the signals from\
  \ the control center.</span> <span m='546970'>The end result is the same in both\
  \ forms of the disease - glucose accumulates to toxic</span> <span m='551420'>levels\
  \ in the blood. If left unchecked, diabetes can lead to kidney failure, blindness,\
  \ and</span> <span m='557129'>heart disease. Feedback loop breakdown leads to the\
  \ development of an unstable internal</span> <span m='562429'>environment. This\
  \ tips the scales towards imbalance, increasing the risk of illness</span> <span\
  \ m='566800'>and progressive damage to the body. Many other diseases and pathological\
  \ conditions follow</span> <span m='571860'>a similar progression.</span> <span\
  \ m='579309'>In this video, you learned about negative and positive feedback loops,\
  \ their general</span> <span m='583660'>components, and how they regulate the flow\
  \ of information. We identified feedback loops</span> <span m='589980'>in the body\
  \ and examined their role in childbirth, thermoregulation, and blood glucose regulation.</span>\
  \ <span m='597100'>Our body relies on a finely-tuned system of checks and balances\
  \ to function smoothly.</span> <span m='602230'>Feedback loops, like the ones described\
  \ in this video, provide this balance. Failure</span> <span m='606279'>of these\
  \ mechanisms, as in the case of diabetes, can be detrimental. We hope that you will</span>\
  \ <span m='611239'>apply your knowledge of feedback loops and the consequences of\
  \ their failure in the study</span> <span m='615139'>of other biological processes\
  \ and diseases.</span> </p>"
