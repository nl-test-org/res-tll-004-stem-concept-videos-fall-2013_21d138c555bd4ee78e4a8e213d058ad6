title: Contaminant Fate Modeling
transcript: '<p><span m=''4580''>At a pristine lake in Ontario, Canada, scientists
  had been adding low levels of estrogen to</span> <span m=''9250''>the lake and were
  watching for changes. The levels were approximately equal to the concentration</span>
  <span m=''14710''>of estrogen found in treated sewage discharge.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''19000''>The result: fathead minnow populations began to collapse!</span> </p><p><span
  m=''23680''>Many of the chemicals that we use and release, whether on purpose or
  by accident, can have</span> <span m=''28109''>severe effects on organisms and ecosystems.
  To predict the accumulation and levels of</span> <span m=''34070''>contaminants,
  we can use differential equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''38409''>This video is
  part of the Differential Equations video series.</span> </p><p><span m=''43220''>Laws
  that govern a system''s properties can be modeled using differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''47909''>Hi, my name is David Griffith, and I''m a graduate student
  in the MIT/Wood''s Hole Joint Program</span> <span m=''53479''>in Oceanography and
  the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''58940''>Before watching this video, you should be familiar with defining control
  volumes and</span> <span m=''63040''>applying conservation of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''66930''>After watching this video, you will be able to: Construct a differential
  equation to estimate</span> <span m=''71640''>the concentration of a chemical in
  the environment; and Appreciate how informed estimates can</span> <span m=''77100''>help
  simplify and solve these differential equations.</span> </p><p><span m=''85800''>While
  everyday chemicals provide a range of</span> <span m=''87700''>benefits to society,
  they are often released into the environment and can cause unintended</span> <span
  m=''92789''>harm. Examples include acid rain from smokestack</span> <span m=''96729''>sulfur
  emissions, toxic groundwater from leaky gas station tanks, and endocrine disruption</span>
  <span m=''103200''>in fish populations due to treated and raw sewage discharges.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''109470''>It would be helpful if we could monitor the levels of
  potentially hazardous chemicals</span> <span m=''113070''>in the environment. But,
  given the tens of thousands of chemicals in daily use, it shouldn''t</span> <span
  m=''118479''>be surprising that measuring all of them is not practical.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''121890''>So, what we need is a framework for simplifying a very complex world.
  We accomplish this through</span> <span m=''128110''>the use of mathematical models,
  which are simplified versions of reality.</span> </p><p><span m=''132920''>Many
  models take the form of differential equations, which describe how one variable,</span>
  <span m=''137410''>like the concentration of a chemical, changes with respect to
  another variable, like time.</span> </p><p><span m=''142920''>By applying conservation
  of mass, we can model the change in chemical concentration with</span> <span m=''147030''>time
  as being equal to the inputs minus the outputs. An input is the rate at which a
  chemical</span> <span m=''154680''>enters our control volume. An output is the rate
  at which the chemical leaves the control</span> <span m=''159400''>volume.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''165920''>To find the inputs and outputs of chemicals</span> <span
  m=''168160''>into a control volume, the first step is to identify the ways that
  chemicals enter and</span> <span m=''172610''>leave the control volume. If we think
  about the estrogen experiment</span> <span m=''176990''>in Ontario, the estrogen
  entered the lake from the scientist intentionally dumping estrogen</span> <span
  m=''181959''>from a motorboat and from the fish themselves.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''187020''>Once released into the lake, there are many ways estrogens can leave
  the lake. A stream</span> <span m=''191599''>could carry the estrogens out of the
  lake. Also, physical, chemical, and biological processes</span> <span m=''197430''>within
  the lake could degrade the estrogens to inactive byproducts.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''203760''>In my own research, I am interested in the fate of estrogens in the
  treated sewage that</span> <span m=''208280''>is discharged into Massachusetts Bay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''212040''>To start, I had two initial questions:</span> <span m=''214110''>1)
  would the estrogen levels in the bay be high enough to detect with our instruments?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''219239''>And 2) how much water would I need to collect?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''223819''>To answer these questions, I needed to estimate the concentration
  of estrogen in the bay.</span> </p><p><span m=''229569''>This is where the differential
  equation comes in. We can set up the equation by setting</span> <span m=''233989''>the
  time change in estrogen concentration (dC/dt) equal to inputs minus outputs.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''242800''>Note that our definition of outputs includes both physical
  flows and chemical reaction</span> <span m=''248180''>rates. What are the possible
  inputs? Because Massachusetts Bay receives 360 million gallons</span> <span m=''255160''>of
  treated sewage discharge from the city of Boston every day, we can assume here that</span>
  <span m=''260548''>sewage is the dominant input. Now, can you think of any removal
  processes</span> <span m=''265500''>(that is, outputs) besides water leaving the
  bay? Pause the video here and write down a couple.</span> </p><p><span m=''280159''>There
  are many possible outputs, including</span> <span m=''282249''>the rates of dilution,
  sedimentation, biodegradation, loss to the atmosphere, and photodegradation.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''291539''>Observe that some of these estrogen outputs remove estrogens
  from the control volume,</span> <span m=''295779''>while others chemically transform
  estrogens into other compounds.</span> </p><p><span m=''303169''>At this point we
  may decide to neglect terms that we suspect will be small given what we</span> <span
  m=''307979''>know about the characteristics of the particular chemical and environment
  that we''re modeling.</span> </p><p><span m=''315139''>For example, we might neglect
  loss to the atmosphere because estrogen''s structure means</span> <span m=''319979''>it
  has a low vapor pressure. In addition, the fact that sewage is discharged</span>
  <span m=''325469''>from a pipe at the seafloor and will be trapped below the sunlit
  surface allows us to neglect</span> <span m=''331219''>photodegradation. We include
  the inputs and outputs into the</span> <span m=''335308''>differential equation
  like so. We''re going to make two more simplifying assumptions</span> <span m=''341339''>to
  make this equation easier to solve. Remember, the goal is not to have a perfect
  model of</span> <span m=''346689''>estrogens in the bay, but to make a quick computation
  to estimate how much water I should</span> <span m=''351129''>collect before I will
  have levels of estrogen that I can detect.</span> </p><p><span m=''356599''>The
  two simplifying assumptions we make are that: 1. The distribution of estrogens in</span>
  <span m=''361789''>the control volume is uniform. That is, the bay is "well mixed.
  2. The concentration is</span> <span m=''368809''>constant in time, that is the
  inputs and outputs are balanced. We could solve this equation</span> <span m=''376059''>without
  assuming that the concentration is constant in time, but this would make our</span>
  <span m=''380289''>solution a lot more complex, so for OUR back of the envelope
  calculation, this is OK.</span> </p><p><span m=''390980''>Let''s look at the terms
  in our differential</span> <span m=''393499''>equation. The input rate is represented
  by the mass flux, which is the mass per time,</span> <span m=''399099''>Q, of estrogen
  leaving the wastewater treatment plant, divided by the volume, V, of the bay.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''406820''>Dilution rate is represented by the dilution rate constant
  K dilution times C.</span> </p><p><span m=''413760''>Sedimentation rate is determined
  in terms of the concentration of estrogens that are</span> <span m=''417969''>attached
  to solid particles, since only the estrogen on solid particles will sink.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''424159''>Keep in mind that the solid particle estrogens are represented
  by some fraction fs of the</span> <span m=''429569''>total concentration.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''431779''>So the sedimentation rate is represented by the sedimentation
  rate constant, k_sed, times</span> <span m=''437819''>the fraction of the concentration
  of estrogen attached to solid particles.</span> </p><p><span m=''444820''>Biodegradation
  rate is represented by the biodegradation rate constant k_deg times C.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''452129''>Assuming steady state we get this equation. Grouping like terms, and
  solving for C we</span> <span m=''458909''>get this. Now we can isolate C and solve
  the equation</span> <span m=''464149''>using what we know or can estimate about
  the chemical or the system.</span> </p><p><span m=''469529''>Once we solved for
  the concentration of estrogen in the bay, we determined that we needed to</span>
  <span m=''473749''>collect 20 liters of water in order to make the necessary measurements.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''482960''>Here you see me on Massachusetts bay collecting water
  samples.</span> </p><p><span m=''487149''>We would collect 8 samples of 20L of water
  per day, extract and concentrate each sample</span> <span m=''493050''>down to 100
  micro liters before high enough levels of estrogens could be experimentally</span>
  <span m=''498039''>measured using a mass spectrometer. The model was key in helping
  me plan my sampling strategy.</span> </p><p><span m=''506020''>It turns out that
  this quick estimate was pretty good, and I''ve collected and was able</span> <span
  m=''510169''>to detect estrogens in Massachusetts bay.</span> </p><p><span m=''513990''>Now
  I can use these measurements to refine my model. For example, I might remove the</span>
  <span m=''518590''>assumption that the concentration is unchanging in time.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''523049''>By comparing measured and predicted concentrations, we
  can also hypothesize about which processes</span> <span m=''528430''>are dominant
  and discover potential missing processes that affect estrogen concentration</span>
  <span m=''534070''>in the bay. Once these hypotheses are well formed, we</span>
  <span m=''538980''>can then design new experiments to test them. And can continue
  to refine the model.</span> </p><p><span m=''545020''>Ultimately, it''s the iterative
  process of taking measurements and refining our model</span> <span m=''550080''>that
  allows us to answer important questions about whether estrogen levels are likely
  to</span> <span m=''555210''>pose a hazard in the bay.</span> </p><p><span m=''562480''>We
  have demonstrated how differential equations</span> <span m=''564830''>and simplifying
  assumptions can be used to help us predict the concentration of a contaminant</span>
  <span m=''569750''>in a coastal bay. We have shown a simple example, but the approach
  can be applied to any chemical</span> <span m=''575750''>in any control volume and
  at any scale. So, the next time you are marveling at the complexity</span> <span
  m=''582320''>of the world around you, you can imagine how you might construct a
  model using differential</span> <span m=''587360''>equations to help you understand
  it better.</span> </p>'
