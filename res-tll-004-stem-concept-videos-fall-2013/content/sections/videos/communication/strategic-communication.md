title: Strategic Communication
transcript: '<p><span m=''3480''>Any time you begin a communication, whether face-to-face,
  in writing, or over the phone,</span> <span m=''8160''>it''s important to think
  about why you''ve opened that line of communication, what the goal</span> <span
  m=''12230''>of your interaction is, and how you''re going to deliver your message.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''16170''>In this video, we''ll watch 3 segments of a presentation
  created by MIT students. You</span> <span m=''20990''>will analyze the strategy
  used to develop the message, and hear how and why the presenters</span> <span m=''25060''>chose
  this strategy.</span> </p><p><span m=''26919''>This video is part of the Communication
  video series. Successful professional communication</span> <span m=''31470''>begins
  with the ability to analyze situational variables and make strategic decisions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''36809''>Hi, my name is Joanne Yates, and I''m a Sloan Distinguished
  Professor of Management and</span> <span m=''41890''>Deputy Dean in the Sloan School
  of Management at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m=''45520''>After watching this video,
  you should be able to use a strategic approach in order to communicate</span> <span
  m=''50640''>effectively. This means that you will be able to</span> <span m=''53680''>Analyze
  your audience, context and purpose Examine and build your own credibility with</span>
  <span m=''58670''>the audience Decide on content, structure, channel, and</span>
  <span m=''63100''>style, and Evaluate your own and other''s messages for</span>
  <span m=''65610''>sound arguments and effective strategy.</span> </p><p><span m=''72610''>As
  we watch the student presentation, think about the following elements:</span> <span
  m=''76500''>Purpose: what is the objective of the presentation? Credibility: Do
  the speakers have credibility</span> <span m=''82250''>with the audience when they
  start the presentation? If not, how do they establish it? For example,</span> <span
  m=''87940''>do they build an argument that shows expertise? Content: Does the material
  support the objective?</span> </p><p><span m=''94670''>Is the argument sound? Does
  the content answer the audience''s questions?</span> </p><p><span m=''98770''>Structure:
  Does the organization of the presentation support what the speakers are trying to
  achieve?</span> </p><p><span m=''105950''>Channel: What methods (demos, schematics,
  animations, text, narration) were used to</span> <span m=''112390''>convey the points,
  and were they effective? Style: Did the style fit the context? For</span> <span
  m=''118560''>example, were the speakers projecting a formal or informal style? Were
  they poised and confident?</span> </p><p><span m=''128919''>This presentation was
  the last requirement in our class for engineering processes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''135680''>The presentation was made in a large auditorium, to around a hundred
  or two hundred</span> <span m=''140880''>audience members. Ranging from Industry
  members to students, to mentors, to late men who didn''t know</span> <span m=''147900''>much
  about engineering processes.</span> </p><p><span m=''156460''>For anyone that uses
  a walker many everyday occurrences loom as obsticles.</span> </p><p><span m=''160920''>Walkers
  can''t be used on steps in the home or in the community.</span> </p><p><span m=''165240''>They
  don''t fit in the narrow aisles of trains, planes, buses, performance venues, or
  sports stadiums.</span> </p><p><span m=''170740''>There''s no room for them in the
  tight corners of restaurants, or most Boston Area apartments.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''181020''>On behalf of Green Team we''d like to introduce to you a solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''183740''>Our product, Walker Prime. A walker that can be transformed
  into a cane.</span> </p><p><span m=''189540''>Through conversations with over 20
  users and their representatives.</span> </p><p><span m=''192560''>We''ve established
  at the market for this product is community ambulators.</span> </p><p><span m=''197040''>These
  are older adults who independently drive, but need the added stability of a walker.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''204000''>For instance one user we spoke to recalled recently going
  to a fancy restaurant</span> <span m=''209480''>and chose to bring his cane rather
  than his walker fearing that their wouldn''t be space in the restaurant.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''215600''>Unfortunately the restaurant had a very large parking
  garage and in traveling from his car to the restaurant</span> <span m=''221320''>he
  became fatigued and really wished he had his walker.</span> </p><p><span m=''224940''>To
  take a look at how Walker Prime could have improved his situation</span> <span m=''227720''>were
  going to do a demonstration with Ran Dedia</span> <span m=''232380''>If she was
  going to meet a friend for lunch in a restaurant downtown and parked a block away</span>
  <span m=''237240''>They could use Walker Prime in walker mode to get to the base
  of the stairs leading up to the restaurant</span> <span m=''241860''>She could then
  by pressing on the lower locks convert Walker Prime into a cane mode</span> <span
  m=''246820''>And using the cane in one hand and the railing in the other she could
  ascend the stairs.</span> </p><p><span m=''253240''>The wheels are lifted above
  the skids, so there''s no chance of them touching the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''258160''>She can then after she''s finished with lunch descend the stairs in
  the same manner.</span> </p><p><span m=''262940''>And to get back to her car she
  can change it back to walker mode to walk the extra block.</span> </p><p><span m=''270420''>Unfortunately
  sometimes there''s a narrow foot path leading to a parking area too narrow for a
  walker</span> <span m=''276360''>Again with Walker Prime this is no longer an obstacle.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''280420''>To see how this played out with an actual user</span>
  <span m=''282960''>We visited a rehabilitation center yesterday and worked with
  a gentleman who is recovering from hip replacement surgery.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''290140''>He too.</span> </p><p><span m=''294140''>He too was able to walk using
  Walker Prime in Walker mode.</span> </p><p><span m=''297520''>And as he approached
  the bottom of the stairs he was able to compress it transforming into a cane.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''303760''>And then ascend the stairs using the cane in one hand
  and for stability the railing in the other.</span> </p><p><span m=''309820''>Later
  he was able to descend the steps in the same fashion.</span> </p><p><span m=''313020''>This
  is what Walker Prime does. If stairs are a thing of your past Walker Prime is not
  going to change that.</span> </p><p><span m=''318440''>But if what''s keeping you
  from the stairs is your walker, that''s a job for Walker Prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''326720''>What was the purpose of the presentation?</span> </p><p><span m=''335500''>The
  purpose of our presentation was to explain why our product was important</span>
  <span m=''339320''>Why would anyone need this kind of transformable walker?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''342760''>To do that we showed different use cases. For example
  we tried to appeal the audience by</span> <span m=''349100''>talking about narrow
  spaces in Boston which people could relate to.</span> </p><p><span m=''353060''>We
  also showed another use case of a user having to walk for a long while in a parking
  lot.</span> </p><p><span m=''360780''>This helped us show the audience that our
  product is important.</span> </p><p><span m=''369040''>Would the audience have found
  the presenters credible?</span> </p><p><span m=''371900''>What did they do to convince
  the audience that their arguments were sound?</span> </p><p><span m=''382160''>Their
  team''s next presentation.</span> </p><p><span m=''384620''>And we actually had
  a bad one for our fifth presentation because the aesthetics of our product.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''391620''>And because we were pretty late in putting it all together.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''395659''>So, and our mentors and the staff of 009 have seen this.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''400840''>So we had to re-establish credibility with our final design
  with our mentors and staff</span> <span m=''405940''>and we tried to convey that
  in our presentation.</span> </p><p><span m=''408960''>We tested walker prime with
  two users in a rehabilitation facility and</span> <span m=''413420''>we had a video
  with one of the users showing how he was able to use our product pretty easily</span>
  <span m=''418360''>climbing up the stairs, climbing down the stairs and transitioning
  it from a walker to a cane.</span> </p><p><span m=''425220''>This was important
  because one, it showed that in reality this is a viable product</span> <span m=''431500''>it
  reaffirmed how functional the product was and it gave us enough credibility with
  the audience to show</span> <span m=''440440''>that this would actually be a good
  product and actually I think a lot of our reviews that came in</span> <span m=''446960''>after
  the presentation did say that we could possibly make this a real product.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''453253''>Let''s continue watching the video.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''457680''>For Walker Prime we wanted to focus on three things.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''460659''>Stability, simplicity, and ergonomic.</span> </p><p><span m=''464420''>This
  is an interesting design challenge because for each of the modes there were different
  requirements</span> <span m=''470340''>For Walker mode we used similar dimensions
  to those of other walkers on the market.</span> </p><p><span m=''476200''>We had
  to be able to make sure that you could adjust the height and still have a stable
  walker.</span> </p><p><span m=''482520''>The legs extend from hip height and are
  angled outward to create lateral stability.</span> </p><p><span m=''488780''>In
  Cane mode we wanted to make sure that you maintain the same handle height in both
  modes</span> <span m=''495100''>which also motivated many of our other design decisions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''499320''>We also looked at other canes on the market and consulted
  physical therapist</span> <span m=''505800''>to determine what an appropriate cane
  footprint would be so that it would also fit on a stair.</span> </p><p><span m=''512059''>Let''s
  take a look at the Walker at the intuitive transition from walker to cane mode.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''518659''>We accomplished this by linking the motion in both directions
  so that it was simple to use</span> <span m=''524400''>so that all the user has
  to do is grab the two locks on either side, disengage them</span> <span m=''529400''>and
  bring your hands together into cane mode.</span> </p><p><span m=''532580''>Let''s
  take a look at the handles. There are 2 handles in walker mode that become 1 in
  cane mode.</span> </p><p><span m=''538660''>The wave allows the handles to come
  together nicely and also provides an ergonomic contour for your fingers.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''546860''>Just below the handles are the safety locks.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''550340''>There are two different locks but they are both passive for simplicity.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''556940''>In order to use active these locks first the user must
  disengage the upper lock and pull the handles apart.</span> </p><p><span m=''565320''>Then
  the locks on either side engage and lock it into Walker mode.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''571760''>Then if the user wanted to make it into a cane again they would just
  simply</span> <span m=''578500''>hit either of the two locks on either side, push
  the walker together, and form a cane again.</span> </p><p><span m=''586100''>Moving
  down to the bottom we have the wheels.</span> </p><p><span m=''590980''>We wanted
  to make sure that the user would be able to use this both indoors and outdoors</span>
  <span m=''596860''>so we did some research and found that 5 inch wheels were necessary
  for outdoor use.</span> </p><p><span m=''605280''>We also need the wheels to clear
  the ground in cane mode, so we had to make the geometry such that</span> <span m=''611540''>as
  you collapse the walker into cane mode the wheels would lift off the ground and
  above the skids.</span> </p><p><span m=''619260''>This brings up to our dual purpose
  skids</span> <span m=''621980''>These skids were designed to be stable in both modes</span>
  <span m=''626380''>There''s a low friction surface for sliding in walker mode and
  a high friction rubber surface</span> <span m=''631220''>for functionality in cane
  mode.</span> </p><p><span m=''634400''>How did you decide what material to include
  in your presentation?</span> </p><p><span m=''638440''>To some extent the material
  was stated by the requirements of the class they said that you need to</span> <span
  m=''643700''>do a financial analysis, you need to tell us how you made this product,
  you need to tell us why anyone</span> <span m=''647680''>would ever buy this product
  or why anyone would make this product.</span> </p><p><span m=''650620''>So that
  was the main reason we included what we did. How we arranged it was a little bit
  more up to us.</span> </p><p><span m=''657320''>So we felt especially given that
  we had a significant non technical portion of our audience</span> <span m=''661020''>It
  was important to motivate the "how" and "why" and show who can benefit from our
  products...</span> </p>'
