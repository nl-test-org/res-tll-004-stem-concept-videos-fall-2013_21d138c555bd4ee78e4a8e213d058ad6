transcript: '<p><span m=''3850''>This is a bungee jumper at the bottom of his trajectory.
  This is a pack of dogs pulling</span> <span m=''9040''>a sled. And this is a golf
  ball about to be struck. All of these scenarios can be represented</span> <span
  m=''14730''>by free body diagrams. Physical problems -- for example, calculating
  the force on the bungee</span> <span m=''20740''>jumper by the bungee cord -- are
  much easier to solve once you''ve drawn a complete and</span> <span m=''25490''>correct
  free body diagram.</span> </p><p><span m=''28430''>This video is part of the Representations
  video series.</span> </p><p><span m=''31820''>Information can be represented in
  words, through mathematical symbols, graphically, or in 3-D</span> <span m=''37899''>models.
  Representations are used to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding of</span>
  <span m=''41699''>objects, systems, and processes.</span> </p><p><span m=''44760''>Hello.
  My name is John Belcher. I am a professor in the physics department at MIT, and
  today</span> <span m=''50089''>I''ll be talking with you about free body diagrams.
  Physics uses many different representations</span> <span m=''56420''>to aid with
  problem solving. Free body diagrams allow us to represent the forces on an object,</span>
  <span m=''62649''>thus enhancing our understanding of situations and helping us
  to solve problems. Studies</span> <span m=''67820''>have shown that students who
  understand and use free body diagrams tend to score better</span> <span m=''72340''>on
  homework, quizzes, and exams. Such representations can be powerful tools for solving
  problems,</span> <span m=''77549''>and remain useful even for physics experts.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''80158''>Our objectives are to improve your skill with free body
  diagrams and to show some of the</span> <span m=''85420''>connections between them
  and the physical situations they represent. I hope you find</span> <span m=''89939''>it
  useful.</span> </p><p><span m=''90039''>We''re going to assume that you have drawn
  a few free body diagrams in the past, so this</span> <span m=''90979''>video will
  start with only a short refresher of how to draw them before getting into some</span>
  <span m=''91859''>more difficult and detailed problems. Here are some guidelines
  to remember when drawing</span> <span m=''96109''>your free-body diagram. Rather
  than trying to sketch an object in detail, we''re always</span> <span m=''101520''>going
  to draw it as a single point. We focus on a single moment in time. Our diagram will</span>
  <span m=''107189''>only include forces, and not any other vectors or any other quantities.
  The arrows we draw</span> <span m=''113320''>for the forces will be longer for stronger
  forces, and we''ll always draw them as coming</span> <span m=''118320''>from the
  object. Finally, we''ll want to draw only forces with a substantial impact on the</span>
  <span m=''124530''>object''s behavior, and leave out any that are negligible.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''127319''>The forces we''ll consider today are primarily those we
  see in the world around us: gravity,</span> <span m=''127509''>the normal force,
  tension, hands pushing or pulling, friction, and so forth. We won''t</span> <span
  m=''127670''>be talking about things like the magnetic force, buoyancy, and so forth,
  but when you</span> <span m=''127850''>encounter those in your courses, they can
  be treated in exactly the same manner as the</span> <span m=''128030''>forces you''ll
  see today.</span> </p><p><span m=''128080''>To keep the length of this video down,
  we''ve had to leave some things out. The first is</span> <span m=''128288''>anything
  to do with circular motion, including torque or centripetal force. Dealing with</span>
  <span m=''128449''>torque requires a more complex approach that you''ll learn later
  on in your course. The</span> <span m=''128619''>second is a complete lesson on
  how to deal with angles in forces and free body diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m=''128818''>That
  is something that you will need to practice on your own in order to really understand</span>
  <span m=''129020''>well.</span> </p><p><span m=''129038''>Let''s do a quick refresher
  on how to draw free-body diagrams. We''ll walk through them</span> <span m=''133160''>one
  step at a time. If you have some paper available you should draw the diagrams yourself</span>
  <span m=''138500''>as we go through the steps.</span> </p><p><span m=''140940''>This
  is very basic example: a falling block. If we ignore air resistance, this is an
  object</span> <span m=''147110''>with just one force applied: the force of gravity.
  We''re going to...</span> </p><p><span m=''152350''>draw the object as a point,</span>
  <span m=''155000''>draw the force of gravity as an arrow,</span> <span m=''157829''>and
  label our force. We''re done.</span> </p><p><span m=''161490''>Let''s build up to
  a more complex example. Here''s the block on a table, stationary.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''166750''>We need to draw the object as a point,</span> <span m=''169590''>and
  draw the force of gravity pulling down on it.</span> </p><p><span m=''172960''>Our
  block is stationary, which means that it is not accelerating. No acceleration means</span>
  <span m=''178620''>a total force of zero, so we must have at least one more force
  in place to cancel out</span> <span m=''183220''>the force of gravity. In this case,
  that cancellation is provided by the normal force from the table.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''188910''>Let''s draw in the normal force.</span> </p><p><span m=''189900''>If
  we wanted to have a hand pushing the object...</span> </p><p><span m=''192750''>...we
  can adjust our existing diagram to include that. All we need to do is</span> <span
  m=''197870''>add an arrow to indicate the force provided by the hand.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''202390''>We can also tilt the table upwards and push the box up the slope. As
  you can see, this</span> <span m=''207880''>tilt changes the direction of our normal
  force, but not the force of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m=''213579''>We could also
  include friction from the surface if we wanted to be more realistic. Now we</span>
  <span m=''218430''>have a fairly complex diagram that visually represents many different
  forces on our object.</span> </p><p><span m=''224460''>Now we''re going to show
  a couple of real-world examples, and show how we would diagram them.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''229070''>Here''s a bungee jumper. This is a very dynamic situation. It''s important
  for us to choose</span> <span m=''235290''>a particular time during the jump at
  which to draw our diagram, because the forces will</span> <span m=''240290''>be
  very different at different times. We can choose any time we like, but we do have
  to</span> <span m=''245530''>pick just one time. Let''s say that we''re interested
  in the time when the jumper is at the bottom</span> <span m=''250670''>of his trajectory.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''252350''>Again, we start with a dot. We don''t draw a stick figure,
  just a single point. And we</span> <span m=''258509''>don''t include the rope, even
  though it is important. We just draw the object in question</span> <span m=''263810''>--
  the jumper.</span> </p><p><span m=''266160''>Gravity is clearly an important force,
  as is the tension from the bungee cord. To determine</span> <span m=''272350''>the
  strength of the tension, we must decide what the acceleration of the jumper is.
  Pause</span> <span m=''278250''>the video to consider this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''286590''>At the bottom of the arc the jumper must be accelerating upwards, so
  as to bounce up.</span> </p><p><span m=''291780''>Therefore, we make sure to draw
  tension as being stronger than the force of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m=''298650''>Looking
  at the diagram at different points during the fall would give us different amounts</span>
  <span m=''302240''>of force. Even though we might like to represent that, it doesn''t
  belong on our diagram. Free</span> <span m=''308620''>body diagrams are drawn at
  a single point in time.</span> </p><p><span m=''313160''>This example involves a
  dog sled.</span> </p><p><span m=''316370''>Let''s draw a diagram of the sled as
  the dogs pull it across the snow at constant velocity.</span> </p><p><span m=''322470''>Here''s
  the sled, "with gravity pulling down, and the normal force pushing upwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''328550''>Here is the force from the dogs, pulling the cart forward.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''333200''>The sled is moving at constant velocity; therefore the
  sled has no acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m=''337770''>Therefore, the total
  force on the sled must be zero. Right now our forces are unbalanced,</span> <span
  m=''344560''>so there must be another force we haven''t drawn yet in order to balance
  out the pull.</span> </p><p><span m=''349060''>That''s the force of friction between
  the sled and the snow.</span> </p><p><span m=''353960''>Once we draw that in, we''re
  done.</span> </p><p><span m=''357380''>Since we know that the sled is moving at
  constant velocity, the sum of our forces should be</span> <span m=''361990''>zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''365470''>Here''s another example: a golf swing. Let''s say that
  we want to draw a free body diagram</span> <span m=''370900''>of the ball just after
  it loses contact with the ground.</span> </p><p><span m=''375490''>You can see that
  the photo is not at a great angle for us to see what''s going on, so let''s</span>
  <span m=''379889''>draw a sketch to help us picture it.</span> </p><p><span m=''382400''>We''ll
  start the diagram with a point representing the ball...</span> </p><p><span m=''386260''>...and
  drawing the force of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m=''389840''>The contact force
  between the ball and the club will be perpendicular to the club, so</span> <span
  m=''395240''>we need to be careful to make sure our angles match. We also need to
  draw a fairly long</span> <span m=''401470''>arrow to represent a strong force,
  because the hit from the club is lifting the ball</span> <span m=''406050''>off
  the ground. We need to make sure that the vertical part of the club''s force is
  stronger</span> <span m=''412840''>than the force of gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''415970''>Since the ball is no longer in contact with the ground, there will
  be no normal force</span> <span m=''420260''>from the grass. We''re all done.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''424510''>Now we''re going to look at some typical mistakes that
  people make when drawing free-body diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m=''428500''>This
  is to help you catch errors in your own work, as well as to assist others during
  group</span> <span m=''433590''>work. Many errors come from breaking the guidelines
  we set forth earlier, so watch for places</span> <span m=''439210''>where those
  are broken as we go through this sequence.</span> </p><p><span m=''442860''>The
  diagrams we''ll show here each have issues with them. To remind you of this, we''ll
  put</span> <span m=''447270''>a red exclamation point in the bottom right corner
  of the screen.</span> </p><p><span m=''452180''>If you''re watching this on your
  own, pause the video when a new example appears, to try</span> <span m=''456800''>to
  find out what''s wrong.</span> </p><p><span m=''458540''>When we correct the diagram,
  we''ll change the exclamation point to a green check-mark.</span> </p><p><span m=''464330''>Here''s
  a diagram with a problem. In this situation we''re trying to show the forces on
  the ball</span> <span m=''469669''>after it is thrown. Try to spot the error.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''474960''>The diagram shows gravity pulling down, and air resistance
  at work, but a ''throwing force''</span> <span m=''480380''>is also included.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''483070''>Because the diagram is intended to be drawn after the
  ball leaves the pitcher''s hand,</span> <span m=''487830''>that force has already
  done its job. There''s no need to include it here. Newton''s First</span> <span
  m=''492949''>Law tells us that the ball will keep moving; it doesn''t need an extra
  force pushing it</span> <span m=''497800''>along all the time.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''500120''>Now the diagram is correct.</span> </p><p><span m=''503270''>Here''s
  our example of a block on a tilted table from before. We''ve drawn in a coordinate</span>
  <span m=''508320''>system to show the x and y directions. We can see that there
  are several forces at work:</span> <span m=''514828''>the pushing hand, the normal
  force, friction, and gravity.</span> </p><p><span m=''520729''>However, there seem
  to be three gravitational forces at work: one pulling straight down,</span> <span
  m=''527180''>one pulling against the normal force, and one pulling down the slope.
  It seems as if</span> <span m=''533240''>the gravitational force has been decomposed
  into x and y components, and then also left</span> <span m=''538980''>on the diagram.
  Once a force has been decomposed, the original should be removed.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''545149''>That''s better.</span> </p><p><span m=''547999''>Here''s a diagram
  of a car driving on the highway. Can you tell what''s wrong here?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''553790''>We have gravity, friction, and a force moving the car forward, but
  this arrows seems to</span> <span m=''560319''>represent a velocity. It might be
  useful information, but it''s not something that gets included</span> <span m=''567279''>on
  a free body diagram. Free body diagrams only include forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''573600''>Let''s remove it.</span> </p><p><span m=''574879''>That''s better.
  But we''re not done yet. According to the diagram, this car is accelerating downward</span>
  <span m=''580510''>-- it''s falling through the road." "We need a force to balance
  out gravity. The car is</span> <span m=''586180''>in contact with the road, so there
  must be a normal force.</span> </p><p><span m=''591089''>There we go. Much better.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''594399''>Here''s our final bad example.</span> </p><p><span m=''597550''>It
  looks like whoever drew this was trying to list every force they could think of.
  Earth''s</span> <span m=''603360''>gravity is something we almost always include,
  and one can understand including air resistance</span> <span m=''608160''>for a
  parachute, but this diagram also has gravity from the moon, gravity from the sun,</span>
  <span m=''614550''>a buoyant force, force from the wind, aerodynamic lift, and whatever
  this F-Z is! We''re practically</span> <span m=''621949''>out of space. One key
  to drawing a free body diagram is narrowing down your forces to just</span> <span
  m=''628720''>those that apply to the problem at hand. Are all these forces present?
  Probably, yes. Are</span> <span m=''636639''>all of them important in your current
  situation?</span> </p><p><span m=''639679''>Probably not.</span> </p><p><span m=''641939''>Simplification
  is an important part of physics. The more complex we make things, the harder</span>
  <span m=''647059''>our problems will be to solve. If our problem tells us to keep
  air resistance, we''ll use</span> <span m=''652379''>that, and ignore other forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''655329''>Now we''re going to look into what our diagrams tell us
  about a physical setup. This will</span> <span m=''659709''>help us refine our understanding
  of these diagrams. After all, if a free body diagram</span> <span m=''664470''>is
  really a representation of what''s going on, it should have a strong connection
  to</span> <span m=''669490''>a physical situation.</span> </p><p><span m=''671550''>Here''s
  a car on the highway. This animation will help us understand the changes in our</span>
  <span m=''676689''>diagram.</span> </p><p><span m=''678100''>We can tell that this
  car is not accelerating. The forces in our y direction balance, and</span> <span
  m=''683759''>the forces in our x direction balance.</span> </p><p><span m=''686809''>That
  means that if we remove or change any of these forces, the car should accelerate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''693369''>For instance, if we reduce the force of friction, the
  car will speed up.</span> </p><p><span m=''698240''>We could also speed up the car
  by applying more force in the forward direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''703220''>Removing
  the force that''s pushing the car forward results in the opposite effect.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''707079''>The car will eventually slow to a halt.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''709889''>Finally, without the normal force, there''s nothing to stop gravity
  from accelerating</span> <span m=''714230''>the car downward.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''716119''>You can see how any change in the physical forces applied can be represented
  on the free</span> <span m=''720600''>body diagram.</span> </p><p><span m=''722639''>As
  useful as they are, there are some situations in which a free body diagram is not
  the right</span> <span m=''727550''>tool for the job.</span> </p><p><span m=''730029''>Some
  situations are so simple that they may not warrant a diagram. There''s no harm in</span>
  <span m=''734160''>drawing it, especially when you''re starting out, but as you
  become more skilled you may</span> <span m=''738300''>be able to do without it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''741209''>Some situations are better solved with a different approach
  entirely. This exercise, for example,</span> <span m=''746949''>calls for the use
  of a different principle: conservation of energy. A free body diagram</span> <span
  m=''752350''>is not likely to shed much light on the problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''755670''>This problem involves rotation and torque. Free body diagrams work
  best with linear motion.</span> </p><p><span m=''762429''>Even though force is involved,
  a free body diagram may not help.</span> </p><p><span m=''766410''>However, a more
  sophisticated diagram may be of assistance. This one shows where the</span> <span
  m=''770939''>forces are applied to the bar, and can be used in the calculation of
  torques. You can</span> <span m=''776499''>see that it is very different from a
  free body diagram. Free body diagrams are only</span> <span m=''782100''>one type
