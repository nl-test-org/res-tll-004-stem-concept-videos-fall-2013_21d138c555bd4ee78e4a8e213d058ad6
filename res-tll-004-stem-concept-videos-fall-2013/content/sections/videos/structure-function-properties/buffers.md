transcript: '<p><span m=''4759''>Here are two solutions, A and B, to which I''ve added
  universal indicator. Here''s the</span> <span m=''10559''>color key. As you can
  see, both of these solutions are around pH 6, very slightly acidic.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''17400''>Now I''m going to add concentrated sodium hydroxide, a strong base,
  to each solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''24160''>It only took one drop of strong
  base to dramatically raise the pH of solution A. The pH of the</span> <span m=''30880''>other
  solution hasn''t changed. Let''s reset. Here are the same two starting</span> <span
  m=''37269''>solutions, A and B, with the same indicator. But this time, I''m going
  to add concentrated</span> <span m=''41870''>hydrochloric acid, a strong acid, to
  each solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''46239''>It only took one drop of strong acid
  to dramatically lower the pH of solution A. The pH of the</span> <span m=''52350''>other
  solution hasn''t changed. OK, let''s look at our pairs of solutions.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''57799''>When we added a strong acid or base to solution A, its pH changed dramatically
  after only</span> <span m=''63269''>one drop! When we added one drop of acid or
  base to solution B, its pH stayed the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''71030''>Let''s
  add more acid and more base to solution B and see what happens.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''77000''>It takes much more acid or base to change the pH of this solution by
  the same amount!</span> </p><p><span m=''82230''>How is this solution able to resist
  changes to its pH when strong acids and bases are</span> <span m=''86780''>added?
  How could we make and use such a solution? In this video, you''ll find out.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''93310''>This video is part of the Structure-Function-Properties
  video series. The structure, function, and</span> <span m=''98270''>properties of
  a system are related and depend on the processes that define or create the</span>
  <span m=''103370''>system.</span> </p><p><span m=''104560''>Hi, my name is George
  Zaidan and I am [attribution] Before watching this video, you should know</span>
  <span m=''111810''>what an acid is, what a base is, be familiar with the concept
  of chemical equilibria, understand</span> <span m=''117140''>what distinguishes
  strong acids or bases from weak ones, and be able to define pH, Ka and</span> <span
  m=''124530''>pKa.</span> </p><p><span m=''126880''>After watching this video, you
  will be able to:</span> <span m=''129810''>Describe how the structure, or composition,
  of a buffer functions to resist changes in</span> <span m=''134549''>pH Explain
  how the choices made in buffer design</span> <span m=''139530''>impact the properties
  of a buffer.</span> </p><p><span m=''146269''>In chemistry, solutions that resist
  changes to their pH when acids or bases are added</span> <span m=''151310''>are
  called "buffers." Solution B in our demo was a buffer solution. Let''s develop a
  molecular-level</span> <span m=''158159''>model of solution B to try and figure
  out how buffers work. First, let''s review our</span> <span m=''163260''>experimental
  data and list the observations our model must satisfy:</span> <span m=''168609''>The
  starting pH was around 6 When we added one drop of strong base (enough</span> <span
  m=''175540''>to change the pH of our control solution), the pH of our buffer solution
  did not change</span> <span m=''182219''>When we added one drop of strong acid (enough
  to change the pH of our control solution),</span> <span m=''187139''>the pH of our
  buffer solution did not change Eventually, after addition of much more strong</span>
  <span m=''194819''>acid or strong base, the pH of our buffer solution did change</span>
  <span m=''199939''>Based on observations 1, 2, and 4, you might think that our buffer
  solution is simply an</span> <span m=''204919''>acid in solution. But it''s not.
  Relying on observation 3, explain why a solution comprised</span> <span m=''211579''>solely
  of an acid in water could not effectively resist changes to its pH when more acid
  is</span> <span m=''218150''>added. Pause the video. Your initial reaction to this
  question is</span> <span m=''228989''>probably that the pH of such a solution would
  always decrease when more acid is added, and</span> <span m=''234779''>therefore
  observation 3 could not be satisfied. This is correct, except for two cases: first,</span>
  <span m=''241629''>the added acid could be exactly the same strength and concentration
  as the acid already present.</span> </p><p><span m=''247260''>In that case, the
  pH wouldn''t change at all, and we might think we were dealing with a</span> <span
  m=''251499''>buffer solution. Second, the added acid could be much weaker or much
  less concentrated than</span> <span m=''256949''>the acid already present. Think
  about it like this: a 1 liter of a 1 molar solution of hydrochloric</span> <span
  m=''263540''>acid can hold its pH if a few milliliters of 0.1 molar acid or base
  is added. In that</span> <span m=''271200''>case, the pH might only change a little,
  and we might also think we were dealing with a</span> <span m=''275409''>buffered
  solution. But in both of these cases, even though it seems as though the solution</span>
  <span m=''280350''>is buffered, that "buffer-like" response depends on the relative
  strengths and concentrations</span> <span m=''285280''>of each acid, not on any
  intrinsic property of the solution.</span> </p><p><span m=''290770''>So if our buffer
  isn''t just an acid, what is it? Let''s review the observations. Observations</span>
  <span m=''297020''>2 and 3, taken together, suggest that there are both acidic and
  basic species present</span> <span m=''302750''>in our solution, since additional
  acid or base must be neutralized to keep pH relatively</span> <span m=''308290''>stable.
  Given observation 1, we can also hypothesize that there would be more acid than
  base, since</span> <span m=''314790''>the pH of the solution is slightly acidic.
  To better understand what might be happening</span> <span m=''320320''>at the molecular
  level, let''s use Legos to model a solution that meets these criteria,</span> <span
  m=''325890''>and see if that model correctly predicts all 4 observations. We''ll
  start with pure water.</span> </p><p><span m=''331880''>We could model water molecules
  using Legos but that would quickly get overwhelming, so</span> <span m=''336900''>we''ll
  use this blue posterboard instead. Now let''s add, say 60 molecules of acid and
  40</span> <span m=''343700''>molecules of base. In real solutions, there are on
  the order of 1022 or more molecules</span> <span m=''350840''>dissolved. That would
  be a lot of Legos, so we''re choosing smaller numbers for convenience.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''355530''>Now, should the acid and base be strong or weak? Let''s start simple
  and make them both</span> <span m=''361440''>strong. So our acid could be HCl and
  our base NaOH. Here''s 60 HCl molecules. This piece</span> <span m=''368940''>represents
  the H+ ion; and this piece represents the Cl- ion. And here''s 40 NaOH molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''377080''>This piece represents the Na+ ion and this piece the OH-
  ion. Remember that strong acids</span> <span m=''383860''>and bases dissociate completely
  in water, so I''m going to take apart all the pieces</span> <span m=''388270''>here.
  And this is our initial model! It contains</span> <span m=''391240''>both acidic
  and basic species, and it contains more acid than base. But this solution will</span>
  <span m=''397580''>not resist changes in pH. Pause the video and explain.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''408530''>The OH- ions would just react with the H+ ions to form
  neutral water. Since there is</span> <span m=''416680''>an excess of H+ ions, we
  would be left with a hydrochloric acid solution after the reaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''422140''>And we''ve already shown that a solution of a strong acid is not a
  buffer. So let''s go</span> <span m=''427490''>back to our criteria. Remember that
  to satisfy these criteria we had the option of selecting</span> <span m=''432590''>either
  weak or strong acids or bases, and last time we selected the strong/strong case.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''438860''>So this time let''s choose a mixture of weak and strong;
  say, a weak acid and strong base.</span> </p><p><span m=''446330''>As before, we''ll
  start with the acid. Here are 100 molecules of a generic weak acid,</span> <span
  m=''454430''>HA. Remember, weak acids don''t dissociate completely when dissolved
  in water. The extent</span> <span m=''458130''>to which a weak acid or base dissociates
  is related to the equilibrium constant, Ka for</span> <span m=''464000''>an acid
  or Kb for a base. These equilibrium constants depend on the chemical structure</span>
  <span m=''469830''>of the acid or base. Pause the video here and write the equilibrium
  expression for a</span> <span m=''475060''>weak acid. The equilibrium expression
  would be this.</span> </p><p><span m=''485210''>We always use concentrations in
  our equilibrium expression, even though in our model we''re</span> <span m=''489200''>using
  number of molecules; but the principle is the same.</span> </p><p><span m=''493920''>When
  we dissolve 100 molecules of weak acid in water, some of them will dissociate, forming</span>
  <span m=''500160''>H+ and A- ions. Some of those H+ and A- ions will react with
  each other to reform HA. But</span> <span m=''508820''>at any given point after
  the system has reached equilibrium, there will be a fixed number</span> <span m=''513380''>of
  HA, H+, and A- ions. Let''s say that at equilibrium, there will be 96 HA molecules,</span>
  <span m=''521690''>4 H+ ions and 4 A- ions. The molecule formed when HA is deprotonated,
  A-, is called the</span> <span m=''529980''>conjugate base. So now we have a model
  of our weak acid. We</span> <span m=''534770''>still have to add our strong base.
  Let''s add 40 molecules of sodium hydroxide. First, the</span> <span m=''543210''>NaOH
  would completely dissociate in water. Now what? 4 OH- ions react with H+ to form</span>
  <span m=''554190''>water. But things don''t end there. The remaining 36 OH- ions
  react with 36 molecules of HA</span> <span m=''563930''>via a typical weak acid-strong
  base reaction, forming 36 molecules of A-, the conjugate</span> <span m=''570430''>base.
  And we''re still not through. Remember that the dissociation of our weak acid HA</span>
  <span m=''577010''>was at equilibrium, and we''ve disturbed the equilibrium by adding
  NaOH. To reestablish</span> <span m=''582840''>equilibrium, our weak acid HA must
  re-dissociate. But it will do so to a lesser extent than</span> <span m=''589440''>if
  it was in pure water, since there are already a substantial number of molecules
  of conjugate</span> <span m=''594340''>base present in solution. Instead of 4 molecules
  dissociating, perhaps 1 will dissociate; the</span> <span m=''601290''>exact number
  could be calculated from the equilibrium constant of the acid. So now in</span>
  <span m=''606990''>solution we have 59 HA molecules, 1 H+ ion, and 41 A- ions. This
  model satisfies the criteria</span> <span m=''616430''>from before, but does it
  explain our four observations from the initial experiment?</span> </p><p><span m=''621440''>Pause
  the video and discuss with a friend. First, is it acidic? Yes, because it has that</span>
  <span m=''633790''>one free H+ in solution. Second, how is it affected by addition
  of acid? Let''s add HCl.</span> </p><p><span m=''642310''>The H+ ions react with
  the A- conjugate base, forming HA. The pH doesn''t change, since all</span> <span
  m=''651290''>the added H+ ions are tied up here. So far, so good. Third, how is
  it affected by addition</span> <span m=''661029''>of base? Let''s add NaOH. The
  OH- ions react with HA, forming water and A-. The overall</span> <span m=''671510''>H+
  concentration doesn''t change, so the pH stays the same. Note that in both of these</span>
  <span m=''676990''>cases, equilibrium would be re-established after addition of
  acid or base by a slight</span> <span m=''682290''>adjustment in the dissociation
  or reformation of HA. So the number of H+ ions does change</span> <span m=''689150''>upon
  addition of acid or base, but it doesn''t change very much, certainly much less
  than</span> <span m=''694130''>if this was pure water. Finally, can we exceed the
  buffering capacity by adding enough acid</span> <span m=''700190''>or base? Definitely:
  if we add more than 59 molecules of strong base or more than 41 molecules</span>
  <span m=''706760''>of strong acid, we will use up all the HA or A-, and then our
  solution will no longer</span> <span m=''712420''>be a buffer. And there we have
  it! We''ve constructed a</span> <span m=''715810''>plausible model of our buffer
  solution: a solution of a weak acid and its conjugate</span> <span m=''720860''>base.
  You can go through an analogous modeling process for a weak base and its conjugate</span>
  <span m=''725720''>acid. That will form a buffer, too. The key to the buffering
  capability of any buffer</span> <span m=''731690''>is that there is a substantial
  amount of both acid and base present at equilibrium. In a</span> <span m=''737440''>buffer
  made with a weak acid and its conjugate base, the acid acts as a reserve of extra</span>
  <span m=''742670''>H+ ions that can react with added base, and the conjugate base
  acts as a sink, a place</span> <span m=''747920''>for the extra H+ ions from the
  added acid to go. In a buffer made with a weak base and</span> <span m=''753630''>its
  conjugate acid, the base acts as the H+ ion sink and the conjugate acid acts as
  the</span> <span m=''759550''>H+ ion reserve.</span> </p><p><span m=''765920''>Why
  would you want to make a buffer solution? Well, let''s say you''re modeling a reaction</span>
  <span m=''769880''>that occurs in human blood. Blood is a buffered solution with
  a pH of about 7.4, so you''d</span> <span m=''776240''>want to make sure that your
  experimental system is also buffered at this same pH. Or suppose</span> <span m=''781390''>you
  study Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium which colonizes the human stomach. Your experimental</span>
  <span m=''787260''>system would need to be buffered at around pH 2. And no matter
  what your target pH, you''d</span> <span m=''792830''>want your system to have a
  high buffer capacity: in other words, you want it to be as resistant</span> <span
  m=''797940''>to pH changes as possible. In designing a buffer solution, you have
  a lot of choices</span> <span m=''803339''>to make. Pause the video and suggest
  a few factors you should consider when designing</span> <span m=''808010''>a buffer
  solution. First, you have to choose your specific acid/conjugate</span> <span m=''818860''>base
  or base/conjugate acid pair. Then, you have to decide how much of the weak acid
  or</span> <span m=''825020''>base you want to use. Finally, you have to decide how
  much of the conjugate species you</span> <span m=''830000''>want to have at equilibrium.
  Each of these decisions affects the pH and buffer capacity</span> <span m=''835440''>of
  your final buffer solution. Let''s look at each in turn.</span> </p><p><span m=''839990''>We
  know that a buffer solution has to have either a weak acid or weak base; but of
  course</span> <span m=''844959''>"weak" encompasses a range of strengths. For example,
  acetic acid is much stronger than</span> <span m=''849800''>boric acid, even though
  both of them are considered "weak" compared to a strong acid like HCl.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''856680''>The strength of the weak acid used will influence the final pH of the
  buffer: as you might guess,</span> <span m=''861600''>the stronger the weak acid,
  the lower the pH of the final buffer.</span> </p><p><span m=''866130''>But we also
  need sufficient conjugate base to make the solution function as a buffer.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''870709''>And so you might also correctly guess that the more of
  the conjugate base we add, the</span> <span m=''874709''>higher the pH of the final
  buffer. But again, that''s not all. Remember the physical</span> <span m=''881680''>significance
  of our weak acid and its conjugate base: the acid is a reserve of extra H+ ions</span>
  <span m=''887250''>that could react with added base, and the conjugate base is a
  sink, a place for extra</span> <span m=''891810''>H+ ions from added acid to go.
  Would a system with an acid to conjugate base ratio of say,</span> <span m=''899190''>20:1
  be an effective buffer? Pause the video. Since the acid reserve is 20 times larger</span>
  <span m=''913810''>than the conjugate base sink, this buffer would be very good
  at resisting pH if base</span> <span m=''918720''>were added, but not very good
  if acid were added. So, it would be a good buffer in only</span> <span m=''924250''>one
  direction. Intuitively, you might expect that a buffer with an acid:conjugate base</span>
  <span m=''929470''>ratio of 1:1 provides the widest range over which the pH is considered
  buffered, and you''d</span> <span m=''934850''>be right. Many real-life buffers
  don''t necessarily have a 1:1 ratio, because of other design</span> <span m=''941209''>considerations
  (for example, target pH). And of course, it''s not just the ratio between</span>
  <span m=''947170''>the acid and its conjugate base that influences buffer capacity.
  Can you imagine a situation</span> <span m=''952200''>in which the acid and conjugate
  base are present in a 1:1 ratio, but the buffer is still not</span> <span m=''957640''>an
  effective one? Pause the video. Suppose we have a buffer system in which the</span>
  <span m=''969339''>concentrations of weak acid and conjugate base are very low,
  in the micromolar range.</span> </p><p><span m=''974850''>Even though the acid to
  conjugate base ratio is 1:1, their absolute amounts are so small</span> <span m=''980080''>that
  the system would get overwhelmed by the addition of even dilute acids or bases.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''986250''>So designing a buffer system requires a delicate balance
  to make sure that the pH is where</span> <span m=''990529''>you want it to be, the
  ratio between the acid and conjugate base is close to 1:1, and that</span> <span
  m=''996589''>there is enough of each species to provide adequate buffering capacity.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1006300''>In this video, we created a conceptual model of a buffer.
  We saw that to effectively resist</span> <span m=''1011019''>changes in pH, a buffer
  must contain a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base</span> <span m=''1015980''>and
  its conjugate acid. We also discussed some of the choices that need to be made when</span>
  <span m=''1020310''>designing a buffer and how those choices may impact the properties
  of the buffer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1025470''>We hope that by better understanding
  the function of various buffer components, this video will</span> <span m=''1029280''>give
  you some context for many of the calculations you''ll need to carry out when dealing
  with</span> <span m=''1033199''>buffer solutions.</span> </p>'
