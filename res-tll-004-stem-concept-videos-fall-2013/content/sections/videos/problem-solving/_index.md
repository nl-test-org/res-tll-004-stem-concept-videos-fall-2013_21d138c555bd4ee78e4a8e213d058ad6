The first chapter determines the units of the differential quantity dx in terms of the units of x, and explores how integration and differentiation affect units. The second chapter works through a physics example computing the work of an applied force on an object. The effects of derivatives and integrals are used to check the units of the physical quantities involved at several steps along the way. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Utilize and apply the key properties of unit analysis: when two quantities are multiplied, their units also multiply, and all terms added, subtracted in an equation must have the same units. Explain how derivatives and integrals affect units.

This is accomplished by using dimensional analysis and a simple experiment to identify the exponents in a formula for the drag force on a car. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Model drag to predict terminal velocities. Determine the fuel efficiency of a car.

First, using a light-hearted example of eating cereal, Niaja explains how to break problems into simpler yet similar pieces. She then explains how to combine solutions of these simpler pieces to recursively or iteratively solve the whole problem. Next, students are presented with a classic string manipulation problem to apply their new skills. Finally, students are given a more complex programming task: solving the Towers of Hanoi problem. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Divide a programming problem into simpler, analogous pieces. Solve the problem by combining solutions to simpler pieces.

Students use dimensional analysis to determine the diameter of a parachute needed to slow a rover to 90m/s in order to safely land on Mars. Students see how the general formula found using dimensional analysis applies on any planet, allowing for the use of experimental data collected on Earth to Mars. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to use dimensional analysis to estimate the size of a parachute canopy that can slow a rover to 90 m/s on its descent to Mars.

Their story is a concrete example of the Scientific Process in practice. It illustrates that although the scientific method is often presented as a didactic list of steps, there is no one fixed sequence of events that occurs in order for important scientific discoveries to be made. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Describe the general steps of the scientific method. Recognize the complex and multi-faceted nature of the scientific process. Explain how the discovery of Helicobacter pylori and its connection to peptic ulcer disease exemplifies key aspects of the scientific process.
