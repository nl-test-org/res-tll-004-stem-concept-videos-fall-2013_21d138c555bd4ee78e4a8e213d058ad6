title: Conservation of Mass
transcript: <p><span m='3310'>What do the growth of a plant and the rusting of a truck
  have in common? Both processes</span> <span m='8750'>involve mass transfer. In this
  video, you'll learn how to apply the concept of a control</span> <span m='14209'>volume
  and the law of conservation of mass to real-world scenarios.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19070'>This video is part of the Conservation video series.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23630'>In order to analyze or modify a system, it is important to understand
  how the laws of</span> <span m='27949'>conservation place constraints on that system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31539'>Hi. My name is Mark Bathe and I am a professor in the Department
  of Biological Engineering</span> <span m='36180'>at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='44350'>By
  watching this video, you will be able to apply the law of conservation of mass to
  real-world</span> <span m='49300'>scenarios.</span> </p><p><span m='49420'>Before
  watching this video, however; you should have had experience with basic reaction
  stoichiometry.</span> </p><p><span m='50990'>In the 18th century, Antoine Lavoisier,
  a French scientist, showed that there is no</span> <span m='56280'>overall change
  in mass when a reaction takes place in a sealed container.</span> </p><p><span m='60650'>This
  observation is called the law of mass conservation.</span> </p><p><span m='65580'>What
  would Lavoisier say about a plant's growth... ...or a car rusting?</span> </p><p><span
  m='76658'>Can conservation of mass be applied to these scenarios?</span> </p><p><span
  m='80600'>Of course it can.</span> </p><p><span m='82420'>By using a conceptual
  tool called a "control volume," we can more easily apply the law</span> <span m='86850'>of
  mass conservation to these scenarios.</span> </p><p><span m='89590'>What is a control
  volume? A control volume is a fictitious boundary that separates a</span> <span
  m='94429'>system of interest from its surroundings. A control volume is NOT a tangible,
  solid</span> <span m='100429'>boundary. Nor does the control volume have to be a
  specific shape or size. A control</span> <span m='107639'>volume can transmit energy
  or mass. A control volume should be seen merely as a tool, and</span> <span m='114329'>defining
  a control volume is a matter of convenience. Depending on the question being investigated</span>
  <span m='120679'>some control volumes may be more convenient than others.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124270'>Before we go back to the growing plant or the rusting car
  example, let's go through</span> <span m='128880'>a more visual example to demonstrate
  the idea of a control volume.</span> </p><p><span m='132709'>Here we have a sink
  filling with water. What if we wanted to know how much water is</span> <span m='136709'>accumulating
  in the basin? What control volume might we choose to help us answer this question?</span>
  </p><p><span m='141260'>Well, what if we were to define the faucet as our control
  volume? We could look at the</span> <span m='146090'>flow into and out of the control
  volume. Would this give us enough information to figure</span> <span m='151610'>out
  how much water is accumulating in our basin? No.</span> </p><p><span m='157230'>What
  if we defined the whole bathroom as our control volume? We could look at the flow</span>
  <span m='162489'>going through all of the plumbing in the bathroom. Would this give
  us enough information to figure</span> <span m='168019'>out how much water is accumulating
  in our basin?</span> </p><p><span m='171430'>Yes, but we'd also have a lot of information
  to deal with. This probably wouldn't be the</span> <span m='177400'>most efficient
  way to solve the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='181980'>What if instead we defined
  the basin itself as the control volume? Ah-ha. We could look</span> <span m='187969'>at
  the flow going into and out of the control volume and figure out how much water
  is actually</span> <span m='192709'>accumulating in our basin. We have enough information
  to figure out what we want to</span> <span m='198150'>know, but not so much information
  that it is cumbersome to deal with.</span> </p><p><span m='202890'>Now, we will
  see how we can use the concept of a control volume and general chemistry</span>
  <span m='206610'>knowledge to better understand the application of the conservation
  of mass to the growing</span> <span m='209790'>plant and rusting car scenarios.</span>
  </p><p><span m='211930'>Back to the growing plant. Let's say that over some period
  of time, the plant grows</span> <span m='217659'>and gains a mass of 25grams. Although
  the plant isn't living in a sealed container,</span> <span m='224420'>we can still
  apply the law of mass conservation to the growing plant by specifying a control</span>
  <span m='229469'>volume and accounting for the mass entering and exiting that control
  volume.</span> </p><p><span m='235989'>Most plants make their food using photosynthesis.
  The overall reaction for photosynthesis is</span> <span m='241930'>carbon dioxide
  plus water plus light energy yields glucose plus oxygen. We'll assume that</span>
  <span m='252030'>the plant's mass comes from glucose and it's downstream products.</span>
  </p><p><span m='257589'>Now please take a minute to think about what control volume
  we might specify to apply the</span> <span m='262630'>law of mass conservation to
  the plant's growth. [short pause]</span> <span m='271720'>If we think of the plant
  as our control volume, we can apply the law of conservation of mass</span> <span
  m='276440'>to perform a mass balance on the system. Any mass that is accumulated
  in our system</span> <span m='282490'>must equal any mass that entered the system
  minus any mass that left the system. This</span> <span m='288720'>is the law of
  mass conservation.</span> </p><p><span m='292710'>What mass is entering the control
  volume? Carbon dioxide and water.</span> </p><p><span m='299449'>What mass is exiting
  the system? Oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m='304060'>Drawing a diagram like this helps
  us keep track of the information that we know and</span> <span m='308229'>the information
  that we don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='312009'>Note that we ignored the light
  energy because we are performing a mass balance. We can substitute</span> <span
  m='319169'>25 grams in for the accumulation term in the mass balance equation. Now
  please pause the</span> <span m='326780'>video here and see if you can figure out
  how much carbon dioxide and water entered the</span> <span m='331770'>system and
  how much oxygen exited the system. Please continue playing the video to see the</span>
  <span m='337340'>worked solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='344159'>Using basic stoichiometry,
  we can see that 37 grams of carbon dioxide entered the system...</span> </p><p><span
  m='357060'>15 grams of water also entered the system...</span> </p><p><span m='371410'>And
  27 grams of oxygen exited the system.</span> </p><p><span m='392289'>We can compare
  these results to our mass balance and see that our inputs minus our output equals</span>
  <span m='398259'>the mass gained by the plant. So, the law of mass conservation
  not only</span> <span m='404259'>holds, but it gives us important insight into the
  process of a growing plant. Fantastic!</span> </p><p><span m='411770'>Now, let's
  turn to our next example, that of a rusting car.</span> </p><p><span m='418129'>The
  car has rusted, but the rust has fallen off of the car, resulting in a decrease
  in</span> <span m='423080'>the mass of the car.</span> </p><p><span m='424580'>Measurements
  show that the car has lost mass, but has mass really not been conserved?</span>
  </p><p><span m='431220'>Let's think about this scenario a little more carefully.
  What is happening when a car rusts?</span> </p><p><span m='438310'>Can we write
  an equation to explain what is happening chemically?</span> </p><p><span m='443710'>Rusting
  happens by iron oxidation. This reaction can be written as 3O2 + 4Fe -> 2Fe2O3.
  Measurements</span> <span m='456509'>show that the car lost 10g of mass. Now please
  take a minute to think about what</span> <span m='463310'>control volume we might
  specify to apply the law of mass conservation to the rusting car.</span> </p><p><span
  m='470310'>[short pause]</span> <span m='474449'>If we define the car as our system
  or control volume, a concept that we introduced earlier,</span> <span m='479669'>we
  can perform a mass balance on the car. Remember, any mass that is accumulated in</span>
  <span m='485129'>our system should equal any mass that entered the system minus
  any mass that left the system.</span> </p><p><span m='493330'>Our system, the car,
  lost 10g of mass. This is a negative accumulation.</span> </p><p><span m='501280'>During
  the rusting process, did any mass enter our system? Yes, the mass due to the oxygen</span>
  <span m='508039'>that reacted with the iron on the car's body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='512679'>In our scenario, where a car has rusted and the rust fell off of the
  car, has any mass</span> <span m='517010'>left our system? Yes. The mass of the
  rust, or iron oxide.</span> </p><p><span m='524890'>Now please pause the video here
  and see if you can figure out how much oxygen entered</span> <span m='529370'>the
  system and how much iron oxide exited the system. Please continue playing the video</span>
  <span m='534490'>to see the worked solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='541730'>Using
  basic stoichiometry, we can see that 4.3 grams of oxygen entered the system...</span>
  </p><p><span m='552640'>and 14.3 grams of iron oxide exited the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='567200'>We can compare this to our mass balance to see that our mass in minus
  our mass out equals</span> <span m='573100'>the negative accumulation of mass of
  our car.</span> </p><p><span m='576360'>Again, the law of conservation of mass has
  served as a useful tool to learn something</span> <span m='581350'>important about
  our system.</span> </p><p><span m='583630'>This video illustrated how the law of
  conservation of mass can be applied to real-world scenarios.</span> </p><p><span
  m='590839'>Although real-world scenarios might seem overwhelming at first, we can
  use a problem-solving tool</span> <span m='595730'>called a control volume to help
  narrow our focus. The law of conservation of mass allows</span> <span m='602050'>us
  to perform a mass balance on the control volume. In other words, any mass that has</span>
  <span m='608540'>accumulated in our system must equal any mass that entered the
  system minus any mass that</span> <span m='614620'>exited the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='616260'>This simple idea will provide a basis for understanding systems throughout
  your time</span> <span m='619389'>at SUTD and beyond.</span> </p><p><span m='619839'>FAANTASTIC!
