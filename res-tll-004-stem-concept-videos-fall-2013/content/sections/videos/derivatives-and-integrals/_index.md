A video clip from the Boston Museum of Sciences Theatre of Electricity helps to transition into a discussion of electrical breakdown, which is described in detail. Students are asked to consider the role of the field and/or the potential in creating a spark during electrical breakdown. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will: Have a clearer picture of the electric field and electric potential. Be able to describe electrical breakdown in terms of the electric field or electric potential.

Symmetry is defined and used extensively, and students have an opportunity to choose a surface that will maximize symmetry for a given situation. The video also includes a brief discussion of when approximations are appropriate, and finishes with MIT professors and postdoctoral students explaining how they think about flux. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Implement Gauss’ Law more effectively. Give an organized view of electric flux. Categorize situations by symmetry. Learn how to choose a Gaussian surface.

Illustrative video clips are drawn from the robotics competition in MIT’s 2.007 Design and Manufacturing course. The video describes both linear and angular motion. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Explain what is meant by the phrase rigid body. Describe restrictions on the motion of a object by using equations of constraint. Use derivatives and integrals to connect different measurements of motion.
