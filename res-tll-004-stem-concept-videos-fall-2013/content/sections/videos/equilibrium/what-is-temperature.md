about_this_resource_text: <h2 class="subhead">Summary</h2> <p>This video motivates
  the statistical mechanics approach through material structure and behavior. Entropy
  is introduced as a natural variable whose derivative with respect to energy is zero
  when the number of microstates is maximized. This derivative is identified as being
  the reciprocal of temperature, and Boltzmann&rsquo;s constant is explained.</p>
  <h2 class="subhead">Learning Objectives</h2> <p>After watching this video students
  will be able to explain how the definition of temperature arises as a derivative
  of entropy with respect to energy.</p> <p>Funding provided by the Singapore University

title: What is Temperature?
transcript: "<p><span m='6220'> Here you see a circuit powered by a battery and connected\
  \ through a light bulb. This section</span> <span m='11389'>of the circuit is made\
  \ from copper foil.</span> <span m='14789'>We can put a cut into the foil to make\
  \ this circuit incomplete. Taking advantage of the</span> <span m='20029'>thermal\
  \ expansion properties of copper, we can place some candles under the foil to provide</span>\
  \ <span m='24939'>enough heat to expand the foil and complete the circuit again!\
  \ Many materials, like metals,</span> <span m='32200'>expand when you heat them.</span>\
  \ <span m='34100'>But other materials, like polymers, shrink when heated. The macroscopic\
  \ properties of</span> <span m='37730'>both of these materials are highly dependent\
  \ on temperature.</span> <span m='39530'>The difference in the macroscopic behavior\
  \ of these two materials is determined by very</span> <span m='44730'>different\
  \ microscopic structure. Statistical Mechanics is the method used to describe and</span>\
  \ <span m='53260'>predict behavior at the macro-scale based on statistical models\
  \ of microscopic behavior.</span> <span m='60780'>The first step to understanding\
  \ the power of Statistical Mechanics, is to use this method</span> <span m='66060'>to\
  \ define and understand temperature in terms of macro state parameters. The notion\
  \ of equilibrium</span> <span m='73890'>will also prove to be useful in this exercise.</span>\
  \ <span m='78110'>This video is part of the equilibrium video series.</span> <span\
  \ m='81230'>It is often important to determine whether or not a system is at equilibrium.\
  \ To do this,</span> <span m='87580'>we must understand how a system's equilibrium\
  \ state is constrained by its boundary and surroundings.</span> <span m='94030'>Hi,\
  \ my name is Jeff Grossman, and I'm a professor in the MIT Department of Materials\
  \ Science</span> <span m='100090'>and Engineering.</span> <span m='101700'>Before\
  \ watching this video, you should be familiar with the second law of thermodynamics,</span>\
  \ <span m='107400'>and the definitions of micro-state, macro-state, and entropy.</span>\
  \ <span m='113670'>After watching this video, you will be able to: Explain how the\
  \ definition of temperature</span> <span m='119030'>arises as a derivative of entropy\
  \ with respect to energy.</span> <span m='129250'>Consider an isolated, insulated\
  \ box of non-interacting particles. We can characterize this box macroscopically</span>\
  \ <span m='137230'>by 3 parameters: the Volume of the box, the Number of particles\
  \ in the box (measured in</span> <span m='143099'>moles), and the total Energy.\
  \ The Volume of the box, and the Number of particles and the</span> <span m='148810'>total\
  \ energy in this box are fixed. Thus a microstate that corresponds to such a macrostate</span>\
  \ <span m='155849'>is the velocity and position {vi, xi} of each particle in the\
  \ box. With this information,</span> <span m='161670'>we can determine the movement\
  \ and position of every particle in the box, and we obtain</span> <span m='166620'>the\
  \ total energy is \xBD mv^2 summed over all particles. As you can imagine, measuring\
  \ changes</span> <span m='175349'>in the system by tracking each and every microstate\
  \ would be a computational nightmare.</span> <span m='181840'>Instead, we consider\
  \ Omega, the number of microstates that correspond to a system with</span> <span\
  \ m='188560'>macro-parameters E, N, and V. Now, let's consider an isolated system\
  \ comprised of two boxes</span> <span m='197040'>of non-interacting particles. The\
  \ wall separating the two boxes allows the transfer energy,</span> <span m='204150'>but\
  \ does not allow particles to cross it. What changes in macro state parameters do</span>\
  \ <span m='209599'>we observe in our system? Pause the video here. The volume and\
  \ number of particles in</span> <span m='221879'>each box is fixed and unchanging.\
  \ Because energy, in the form of heat, can be transferred</span> <span m='228519'>through\
  \ the wall, E1 and E2 can change. But of course, the total energy E = E1 + E2 stays</span>\
  \ <span m='237440'>the same, because the 2-box system is thermally isolated. Let's\
  \ count the total number of</span> <span m='243709'>microstates that the composite\
  \ system can have, which correspond to a total system energy</span> <span m='249599'>E.\
  \ The easiest way to do this is to first define a new function f(E1), which is the</span>\
  \ <span m='256889'>number of microstates of the composite system when box 1 has\
  \ energy E1. To do this, we count</span> <span m='264290'>the number of microstates\
  \ where box 1 has some energy E1, and multiply this by the number</span> <span m='270430'>of\
  \ microstates where box 2 has energy E-E1. Then, to find the total number of microstates</span>\
  \ <span m='280000'>for the composite system, we need to sum the function f over\
  \ all ways we could have selected</span> <span m='286120'>E1. We want to understand\
  \ more about this function f because it is key to defining Omega.</span> <span m='294320'>Let's\
  \ look at a typical example to see what f looks like.</span> <span m='299030'>We\
  \ can explore the function f by considering a simple case, where each particle can\
  \ only</span> <span m='304150'>exist in one of 2 allowable energy states\u2014one\
  \ with energy 0 and the other with 1. Suppose</span> <span m='312910'>I have 50\
  \ particles in box 1 and 100 particles in box 2, and the total energy of the system</span>\
  \ <span m='319560'>is fixed at, say, 50. In order to reach this total energy, the\
  \ energy E1 in box 1 can range</span> <span m='327400'>from 0 to 50. This is the\
  \ graph for the number of microstates with total energy E having</span> <span m='334460'>a\
  \ given E1. We get this graph by looking at all ways to assign every particle a\
  \ 0 or 1</span> <span m='342130'>state such that the energy in box 1 is E1 and the\
  \ energy in box 2 is E-E1. We can imagine</span> <span m='350150'>that the sum that\
  \ defines omega is the area under this graph.</span> <span m='356080'>Look at how\
  \ peaked this graph is! With increasing numbers of particles, the graph becomes\
  \ more</span> <span m='363310'>and more strongly peaked. Remember, in a realistic\
  \ situation, the number of particles is going</span> <span m='370509'>to be on the\
  \ order of Avagadro's number. Which means the distribution of energies will be</span>\
  \ <span m='376150'>highly peaked with a very small standard deviation. Statistically,\
  \ this means as the Number of</span> <span m='383650'>particles becomes larger,\
  \ the energy in box 1 is almost always very close to this peak</span> <span m='389770'>value.\
  \ Let's define Em to be the box 1 energy corresponding to the peak value of f. So\
  \ how</span> <span m='400270'>do we find Em? Pause the video and think about it.\
  \ To find Em, we want to maximize the function</span> <span m='413340'>f with respect\
  \ to E1.</span> <span m='415630'>Since the volume, number, and total energy of the\
  \ system are fixed, differentiate f with</span> <span m='421080'>respect to E1.\
  \ The maximum occurs when this derivative is zero.</span> <span m='426770'>Take\
  \ a moment to carry out this derivative, and check your solution with ours. Pause\
  \ the</span> <span m='431720'>video.</span> <span m='439440'>We obtain the following\
  \ expression. Thus the Energy Em that leads to the greatest number</span> <span\
  \ m='446960'>of composite system microstates is defined by this elegant condition.</span>\
  \ <span m='452610'>So let's define a new macro-parameter, S, called \"entropy\"\
  . The kB is Boltzmann's constant.</span> <span m='460669'>We'll explain why we include\
  \ it later. By defining this new term, entropy, our condition</span> <span m='466800'>above\
  \ occurs when the derivative of the entropy of box 1 with respect to the energy\
  \ of box</span> <span m='473020'>1 is equal to the derivative of the entropy of\
  \ box 2 with respect to the energy of box</span> <span m='479039'>2.</span> <span\
  \ m='485960'>So on average, we expect the energy of box 1 to be very close to Em.\
  \ But what happens</span> <span m='493520'>if box 1 starts with some different energy,\
  \ maybe an energy significantly different from</span> <span m='498819'>Em? Statistically,\
  \ because such a state is so much less likely, when contact between</span> <span\
  \ m='505880'>the boxes is made, the energy will redistribute over time towards the\
  \ most likely state, where</span> <span m='512209'>box 1 has energy Em.</span> <span\
  \ m='515349'>This process of energy redistribution is called equilibration. And\
  \ the state with the highest</span> <span m='522139'>likelihood is called equilibrium!</span>\
  \ <span m='525449'>How do we know we've landed in an equilibrium state? If the derivative\
  \ condition we found</span> <span m='530899'>earlier, evaluated at the average energy\
  \ of each box is held, it indicates that we are</span> <span m='537329'>at equilibrium.\
  \ Note that in the simple example scenario we considered earlier, it was NOT</span>\
  \ <span m='544660'>the case that the energy of each box was the same. It is the\
  \ derivative of entropy with</span> <span m='549999'>respect to energy for each\
  \ box evaluated at the energy, number, and volume of each box</span> <span m='555879'>that\
  \ must be equal at equilibrium.</span> <span m='560189'>This suggests that we should\
  \ define the derivative of entropy with respect to energy to be a</span> <span m='566470'>new\
  \ system variable. But what would this variable represent physically?</span> <span\
  \ m='573670'>To figure out what it should be, think about our composite system.\
  \ The volume of each box</span> <span m='580300'>is constant as is the number of\
  \ particles in each box. The wall between the two boxes</span> <span m='586779'>allows\
  \ energy to transfer. Over time, what parameter will eventually be the same for</span>\
  \ <span m='593970'>both boxes? Pause the video and discuss.</span> <span m='604160'>Our\
  \ experience tells us that once 2 subsystems are brought into thermal contact, we\
  \ expect</span> <span m='609410'>the composite system will eventually evolve so\
  \ that each box has the same temperature!</span> <span m='615959'>But at equilibrium\
  \ the derivative of entropy with respect to energy of each box is also</span> <span\
  \ m='621249'>equal. This tells us that this derivative should be some function of\
  \ temperature. In</span> <span m='628389'>fact, the derivative of entropy with respect\
  \ to energy is exactly equal to the reciprocal</span> <span m='634110'>of temperature!\
  \ This tells us that when we are measuring temperature of a system, we</span> <span\
  \ m='640519'>are NOT measuring the energy of a system, we are measuring this derivative!</span>\
  \ <span m='645989'>There are specific units determined by the typical way we measure\
  \ temperature. This is</span> <span m='651309'>why Boltzmann's constant was introduced\
  \ into the definition of entropy! The constant is</span> <span m='656910'>introduced\
  \ precisely so that the derivative of entropy with respect to energy has dimension</span>\
  \ <span m='662980'>of 1/temperature.</span> <span m='672279'>In this video we've\
  \ seen that entropy is a natural macrostate parameter, and statistically</span>\
  \ <span m='678410'>a system's microstates evolve to exist within the maximum entropy\
  \ state. This is called</span> <span m='684639'>equilibrium. Temperature is naturally\
  \ defined as the derivative of entropy with respect</span> <span m='691519'>to energy\
  \ for a system. And this definition allows us to understand how temperature and</span>\
  \ <span m='697619'>entropy are related at equilibrium.</span> </p>"
