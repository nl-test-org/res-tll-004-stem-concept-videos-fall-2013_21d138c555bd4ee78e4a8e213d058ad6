title: Dimensional Analysis
transcript: "<p><span m='2919'> On the evening of August 5, 2012 Pacific Daylight\
  \ Time, NASA's Mars Rover, named Curiosity,</span> <span m='9139'>entered Mars'\
  \ atmosphere at 20,000km/h. Drag slowed it down to around 1600km/hr, at which</span>\
  \ <span m='19449'>point a parachute opened. This parachute slowed the Rover more,\
  \ to about 320km/hr, or 90 m/s.</span> <span m='28769'>Finally, after rockets decelerated\
  \ it completely, the rover was lowered to the surface of Mars.</span> <span m='34699'>Every\
  \ step of this dance was carefully choreographed and rehearsed in many experiments\
  \ here on</span> <span m='40780'>Earth. But how could NASA engineers be sure that\
  \ their designs would work on a totally</span> <span m='47129'>different planet?\
  \ The answer is a problem-solving method called dimensional analysis.</span> <span\
  \ m='54780'>This video is part of the Problem Solving video series.</span> <span\
  \ m='59299'>Problem-solving skills, in combination with an understanding of the\
  \ natural and human-made</span> <span m='63319'>world, are critical to the design\
  \ and optimization of systems and processes.</span> <span m='67009'>Hi, my name\
  \ is Ken Kamrin, and I am a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. Dimensional</span>\
  \ <span m='73899'>analysis is a powerful tool; I use it, NASA uses it, and you will\
  \ too.</span> <span m='80600'>Before watching this video, you should be familiar\
  \ with unit analysis, and understand</span> <span m='84960'>the difference between\
  \ dependent and independent variables.</span> <span m='88280'>By the end of this\
  \ video, you will be able to use dimensional analysis to estimate the</span> <span\
  \ m='92109'>size of a parachute canopy that can slow the Rover down to 90 m/s on\
  \ its descent to Mars.</span> <span m='104060'>Before we talk about dimensional\
  \ analysis, we need to know what dimension is. Dimensions</span> <span m='109630'>and\
  \ units are related, but different, concepts. Physical quantities are measured in\
  \ units.</span> <span m='116100'>The dimension of the physical quantity is independent\
  \ of the particular units choosen.</span> <span m='121090'>For example: Both grams\
  \ and kilograms are units, but they</span> <span m='125569'>are units of mass.And\
  \ mass is what we'll call the dimension.</span> <span m='130810'>There are 5 fundamental\
  \ dimensions that we commonly deal with: length, mass, time, temperature,</span>\
  \ <span m='139319'>and charge.</span> <span m='141260'>All other dimensions are\
  \ obtained by taking products and powers of these fundamental dimensions.</span>\
  \ <span m='147510'>In this video, we'll be dealing with length, which we denote\
  \ by the letter</span> <span m='151620'>L, mass, which we denote M, and time, T.\
  \ For example, no matter how you measure the physical</span> <span m='161150'>quantity\
  \ velocity, it has the dimension, which we denote with square brackets, of length</span>\
  \ <span m='167450'>divided by time, or length times time to the negative 1 power.</span>\
  \ <span m='172950'>Pause the video here and determine the dimension of energy.</span>\
  \ <span m='183260'>Energy has dimension Mass times</span> <span m='186129'>Length\
  \ squared over Time squared.</span> <span m='190060'>Okay, great, so what's the\
  \ big deal? How is this useful?</span> <span m='197480'>Remember NASA's rover? Part\
  \ of the landing sequence calls for a parachute to slow the</span> <span m='202720'>vehicle\
  \ down. Suppose it is our job to design the parachute to slow the Rover to exactly</span>\
  \ <span m='208620'>90m/s. The terminal velocity of the Rover depends on the mass\
  \ of the rover itself and</span> <span m='214680'>its heat shield, and several different\
  \ variables related to the parachute design: the material</span> <span m='220480'>of\
  \ the canopy, the diameter of the hemispherical parachute canopy, the number of\
  \ suspension</span> <span m='225939'>lines, etc.</span> <span m='228540'>For simplicity,\
  \ let's suppose that all parachute parameters other than the diameter of the</span>\
  \ <span m='232920'>canopy have already been determined. Our goal is to find the\
  \ canopy diameter that is as</span> <span m='239319'>small as possible, but will\
  \ correspond to the desired terminal velocity of 90 m/s.</span> <span m='246599'>Clearly,\
  \ we can't test our designs on Mars. The question is: how can we get meaningful</span>\
  \ <span m='253439'>data here on Earth that will allow us to appropriately size the\
  \ parachute for use on Mars? How do</span> <span m='260910'>we predict the behavior\
  \ of a parachute on Mars based on an Earth experiment? And what</span> <span m='265790'>variables\
  \ do we need to consider in designing our experiment on Earth? This is where a problem</span>\
  \ <span m='271300'>solving method called dimensional analysis can help us.</span>\
  \ <span m='280720'>Before we get started, we must first determine what the dependent\
  \ and independent variables</span> <span m='285780'>are in our system.</span> <span\
  \ m='288380'>The dependent variable is terminal velocity.</span> <span m='292440'>This\
  \ is the quantity that we wish to constrain by our parachute design. So what variables</span>\
  \ <span m='298350'>affect the terminal velocity of the parachute and rover system?</span>\
  \ <span m='302700'>The diameter of the parachute canopy is one such independent\
  \ variable. Take a moment to</span> <span m='308080'>pause the video and identify\
  \ others.</span> <span m='316500'>Ok. Here's our list: canopy diameter, mass of\
  \ the Rover (we assume the mass of the parachute</span> <span m='324220'>to be negligible),\
  \ acceleration due to gravity, and the density and viscosity of the atmosphere.</span>\
  \ <span m='333370'>For this problem, we can assume that the dependence of the terminal\
  \ velocity on atmospheric viscosity</span> <span m='338440'>is negligible, because\
  \ the atmosphere on Mars like the atmosphere on Earth is not very viscous.</span>\
  \ <span m='346120'>If we wanted to derive a functional relationship that would work,\
  \ for example, underwater,</span> <span m='351060'>it would be important that we\
  \ include viscosity as an independent variable.</span> <span m='356020'>Why didn't\
  \ we include the surface area of the parachute canopy in our list of independent</span>\
  \ <span m='360090'>variables?</span> <span m='361850'>Pause the video and take a\
  \ moment to discuss with a classmate.</span> <span m='371260'>We didn't include\
  \ the surface area of the canopy, because it is not independent from</span> <span\
  \ m='375520'>the diameter of the canopy.</span> <span m='376920'>In fact, we can\
  \ determine the area as a function of diameter. So we don't need both!</span> <span\
  \ m='383150'>Question: Could we use the surface area instead of the diameter? Absolutely.\
  \ We need the variables</span> <span m='390770'>to be independent, but it doesn't\
  \ matter which variables we use! The key is to have identified</span> <span m='397090'>all\
  \ of the correct variables to begin with. This is where human error can come into\
  \ play.</span> <span m='403330'>If our list of variables isn't exhaustive, the relationship\
  \ we develop through dimensional</span> <span m='407430'>analysis may not be correct!</span>\
  \ <span m='411750'>Once we have the full list of independent variables, we can express\
  \ the terminal velocity</span> <span m='416159'>as some function of these independent\
  \ variables.</span> <span m='420780'>In order to find the function that describes\
  \ the relationship, we need do several experiments</span> <span m='425880'>involving\
  \ 4 independent variables, and fit the data. Phew, that's a lot of work! Especially</span>\
  \ <span m='432620'>because we don't know what the function might look like.</span>\
  \ <span m='436970'>But whenever you have an equation, all terms in the equation\
  \ must have the same dimension.</span> <span m='443640'>Multiplying two terms multiplies\
  \ the dimensions.</span> <span m='448590'>This restricts the possible form that\
  \ a function describing the terminal velocity in terms</span> <span m='453240'>of\
  \ our 4 other variables can take, because the function must combine the variables\
  \ in</span> <span m='458860'>some way that has the same dimension as velocity.</span>\
  \ <span m='464550'>And many functions\u2014exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric\
  \ --cannot have input variables</span> <span m='471270'>that have dimension. What\
  \ would e to the 1kg mean? What units could it possibly have?</span> <span m='479370'>We're\
  \ going to show you a problem solving method that will allow you to find the most</span>\
  \ <span m='483780'>general form of such a function. This method is called dimensional\
  \ analysis.</span> <span m='494210'>We begin this process by creating dimensionless\
  \ versions of the variables in our system. We</span> <span m='500360'>create these\
  \ dimensionless expressions out of the variables in our system, so we don't</span>\
  \ <span m='504390'>introduce any new physical parameters.</span> <span m='508510'>The\
  \ first step is to take our list of variables, and distill them down to their fundamental</span>\
  \ <span m='512719'>dimensions.</span> <span m='514360'>Remember our fundamental\
  \ dimensions are length, mass, and time.</span> <span m='519000'>Distilling gravity\
  \ to its fundamental dimension, we get length per time squared. Now you distill</span>\
  \ <span m='526500'>the remaining variables of velocity, diameter, mass, and density\
  \ into their fundamental dimensions.</span> <span m='534170'>Pause the video here.</span>\
  \ <span m='542040'>Velocity is length per time; diameter is length; mass is mass;\
  \ and density is mass per length</span> <span m='548889'>cubed.</span> <span m='551290'>The\
  \ second step is to express the fundamental dimensions of mass, length, and time\
  \ in terms</span> <span m='555910'>of our independent variables.</span> <span m='558040'>We\
  \ can write M as little m.</span> <span m='560920'>We can write L as mass divided\
  \ by density to the 1/3 power.</span> <span m='566819'>We can write T as velocity\
  \ divided by gravity.</span> <span m='572439'>We had many choices as to how to write\
  \ these fundamental dimensions in terms of our variables.</span> <span m='577980'>In\
  \ the end, it doesn't matter which expressions you choose.</span> <span m='582769'>The\
  \ third step is to use these fundamental dimensions to turn all of the variables\
  \ involved</span> <span m='587980'>into dimensionless quantities. For example, the\
  \ terminal velocity v has dimension of length</span> <span m='595339'>over time.\
  \ So we multiply v by the dimension of time, and divide by the dimension of length</span>\
  \ <span m='609639'>to get a dimension of one.</span> <span m='615689'>We define\
  \ a new dimensionless variable vbar as this dimensionless version of v.</span> <span\
  \ m='626040'>Now you try; find dbar, mbar, gbar, and rhobar. Pause the video here.</span>\
  \ <span m='642480'>You should have found that dbar is d times rho over m to the\
  \ 1/3.</span> <span m='648840'>Mbar is 1. Gbar is v squared over g times rho over</span>\
  \ <span m='656339'>m to the 1/3., and rho bar is 1.</span> <span m='661240'>Now\
  \ we can rewrite the equation for velocity in terms of the new dimensionless variables.</span>\
  \ <span m='667110'>It is a new function, because the variables have been modified.\
  \ Notice that vbar is equal</span> <span m='672709'>to gbar. This means that vbar\
  \ and gbar are not independent! So our function for vbar</span> <span m='681339'>cannot\
  \ depend on gbar. Also, notice that mbar and rho bar are both equal to one, so our</span>\
  \ <span m='689009'>function doesn't depend on them either.</span> <span m='692939'>This\
  \ has simplified our relationship: vbar is a function of only one variable, dbar.</span>\
  \ <span m='700790'>And remember that dbar is dimensionless, so it is just a real\
  \ number. This means that,</span> <span m='706819'>phi can be any function.</span>\
  \ <span m='710949'>The forth and final step is to rearrange to find a formula for\
  \ the terminal velocity.</span> <span m='716709'>The key here is that this equation\
  \ for the terminal velocity has the correct units.</span> <span m='724029'>And this\
  \ formula is so general, that any expression with dimension of Length over Time\
  \ can be</span> <span m='729879'>written in terms of this formula by defining phi\
  \ in different ways. Let's see how. First,</span> <span m='738079'>create an expression\
  \ from the independent variables that has the same dimension as velocity.</span>\
  \ <span m='743559'>One such expression is the square root of g times d. By setting\
  \ the formula for v equal</span> <span m='750550'>to the square root of gd, we see\
  \ that by setting phi equal to the identity function phi(x)</span> <span m='758580'>=\
  \ x, the two sides of the equation can be made equal.</span> <span m='764050'>And\
  \ in fact, we claim that any expression with the correct dimension of Length over</span>\
  \ <span m='769220'>time created using these variables can be written in terms of\
  \ this formula by simply</span> <span m='774800'>changing the definition of phi!</span>\
  \ <span m='777949'>It can be fun to try this. Come up with different formulas that\
  \ have the correct dimension.</span> <span m='783339'>You can even add them together.\
  \ Then see if you can find a way to define phi so that our</span> <span m='788069'>formula\
  \ is equal to the expression you wrote. Pause the video here.</span> <span m='798699'>Now\
  \ you may be concerned because this formula is not unique. We made some choices\
  \ about</span> <span m='803850'>how to represent our fundamental dimensions. What\
  \ happens if we make different choices?</span> <span m='811490'>Here we chose M,\
  \ L, and T this way: M was little m, L was d, and T was v over g. Running through</span>\
  \ <span m='824069'>the dimensional analysis process with this choice of fundamental\
  \ dimensions, we obtain</span> <span m='828779'>an equation for v that looks like\
  \ this.</span> <span m='831980'>To see that these two formulas are equivalent, we\
  \ set the arguments under the square root</span> <span m='837500'>equal, and find\
  \ that we can express phi as a function of psi.</span> <span m='855840'>So any formula\
  \ with the</span> <span m='858040'>correct dimension can be expressed by this general\
  \ formula.</span> <span m='864170'>And this general formula works for any rover\
  \ on any planet whose terminal velocity through</span> <span m='870559'>the atmosphere\
  \ depends on the same variables. Because it is a general law!</span> <span m='881410'>Of\
  \ course, we still don't know what this function phi is! In order to find phi, we\
  \ can fit experimental</span> <span m='887660'>data from any planet, for example,\
  \ Earth. On Earth, we know the gravity and atmospheric</span> <span m='895610'>density.\
  \ We can specify the mass of a test rover to be 10kg.</span> <span m='902129'>Then\
  \ we might set up Earth bound experiments by varying the canopy diameter of a parachute</span>\
  \ <span m='906559'>between 1m to 20m and measuring the terminal velocity. For example,\
  \ suppose we obtained</span> <span m='913720'>the following data on Earth.</span>\
  \ <span m='918300'>Then we could convert this data to the dbar, vbar axes, by scaling\
  \ the variables v and</span> <span m='924220'>d according to the Earth values for\
  \ the mass, gravity, and atmospheric density. We can fit</span> <span m='932689'>this\
  \ data to some best-fit curve. And this best fit curve is our best approximation\
  \ to</span> <span m='937899'>the function phi.</span> <span m='940999'>Now that\
  \ we have phi, we can transform the axes again to represent the canopy diameter</span>\
  \ <span m='947170'>and terminal velocity on Mars. This is done by converting vbar\
  \ and dbar to v and d by</span> <span m='955860'>scaling according to known values\
  \ of the gravity, atmospheric density, and mass of the rover</span> <span m='961759'>on\
  \ Mars!</span> <span m='964579'>To find the diameter, we find the point on the v-axis\
  \ that corresponds to a terminal</span> <span m='970209'>velocity of 90m/s, and\
  \ use our curve to determine the diameter that corresponds to this terminal</span>\
  \ <span m='977939'>velocity! Now we have the specification we need to design the\
  \ size of our parachute to</span> <span m='984249'>be used on the descent to Mars!</span>\
  \ <span m='991490'>In this example, we used dimensional analysis to restrict the\
  \ possible form of a function</span> <span m='996040'>describing the terminal velocity\
  \ of the Mars rover as a function of parachute canopy diameter,</span> <span m='1002550'>gravitational\
  \ acceleration, atmospheric density, and the mass of the rover.</span> <span m='1008220'>This\
  \ allowed us to design a parachute for use on Mars based on Earth bound experiments.</span>\
  \ <span m='1015620'>In general, the process of dimensional analysis involves...\
  \ 1.</span> <span m='1020360'>Identifying the dependent variable and independent\
  \ variables,</span> <span m='1025079'>2. Expressing the relevant fundamental dimensions\
