title: Conditional Probability
transcript: '<p><span m=''2530''>You''ve tested positive for a rare and deadly cancer
  that afflicts 1 out of 1000 people,</span> <span m=''7220''>based on a test that
  is 99% accurate. What are the chances that you actually have the</span> <span m=''11980''>cancer?
  By the end of this video, you''ll be able to answer this question!</span> </p><p><span
  m=''17560''>This video is part of the Probability and Statistics video series. Many
  natural and</span> <span m=''22510''>social phenomena are probabilistic in nature.
  Engineers, scientists, and policymakers often</span> <span m=''28260''>use probability
  to model and predict system behavior.</span> </p><p><span m=''31930''>Hi, my name
  is Sam Watson, and I''m a graduate student in mathematics at MIT.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''38469''>Before watching this video, you should be familiar with basic probability
  vocabulary</span> <span m=''43679''>and the definition of conditional probability.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''46989''>After watching this video, you''ll be able to: Calculate
  the conditional probability</span> <span m=''51219''>of a given event using tables
  and trees; and Understand how conditional probability can</span> <span m=''56269''>be
  used to interpret medical diagnoses.</span> </p><p><span m=''64479''>Suppose that
  in front of you are two bowls, labeled A and B. Each bowl contains five marbles.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''71600''>Bowl A has 1 blue and 4 yellow marbles. Bowl B has 3 blue
  and 2 yellow marbles.</span> </p><p><span m=''78240''>Now choose a bowl at random
  and draw a marble uniformly at random from it. Based on your</span> <span m=''83229''>existing
  knowledge of probability, how likely is it that you pick a blue marble? How about</span>
  <span m=''88200''>a yellow marble?</span> </p><p><span m=''93109''>Out of the 10
  marbles you could choose from, 4 are blue. So the probability of choosing a blue</span>
  <span m=''115130''>marble is 4 out of 10.</span> </p><p><span m=''118020''>There
  are 6 yellow marbles out of 10 total, so the probability of choosing yellow is 6</span>
  <span m=''123109''>out of 10.</span> </p><p><span m=''123270''>When the number of
  possible outcomes is finite, and all events are equally likely, the probability</span>
  <span m=''124109''>of one event happening is the number of favorable outcomes divided
  by the total number of possible</span> <span m=''125009''>outcomes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''125070''>What if you must draw from Bowl A? What''s the probability of drawing
  a blue marble,</span> <span m=''129470''>given that you draw from Bowl A?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''138239''>Let''s go back to the table and consider only Bowl A.
  Bowl A contains 5 marbles of which</span> <span m=''145599''>1 is blue, so the probability
  of picking a blue one is 1 in 5.</span> </p><p><span m=''151300''>Notice the probability
  has changed. In the first scenario, the sample space consists</span> <span m=''156610''>of
  all 10 marbles, because we are free to draw from both bowls.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''162329''>In the second scenario, we are restricted to Bowl A. Our new sample
  space consists of</span> <span m=''168220''>only the five marbles in Bowl A. We
  ignore these marbles in Bowl.</span> </p><p><span m=''175670''>Restricting our attention
  to a specific set of outcomes changes the sample space, and</span> <span m=''180909''>can
  also change the probability of an event. This new probability is what we call a
  conditional</span> <span m=''187730''>In the previous example, we calculated the
  conditional probability of drawing a blue</span> <span m=''188370''>marble, given
  that we draw from Bowl A.</span> </p><p><span m=''189659''>This is standard notation
  for conditional probability. The vertical bar ( | ) is read</span> <span m=''194510''>as
  "given." The probability we are looking for precedes the bar, and the condition
  follows</span> <span m=''205099''>the bar.</span> </p><p><span m=''212299''>Now
  let''s flip things around. Suppose someone picks a marble at random from either
  bowl</span> <span m=''217439''>A or bowl B and reveals to you that the marble drawn
  was blue. What is the probability that</span> <span m=''223939''>the blue marble
  came from Bowl A?</span> </p><p><span m=''226989''>In other words, what''s the conditional
  probability that the marble was drawn from Bowl A, given</span> <span m=''232159''>that
  it is blue? Pause the video and try to work this out.</span> </p><p><span m=''241159''>Going
  back to the table, because we are dealing with the condition that the marble is
  blue,</span> <span m=''246400''>the sample space is restricted to the four blue
  marbles.</span> </p><p><span m=''251170''>Of these four blue marbles, one is in
  Bowl A, and each is equally likely to be drawn.</span> </p><p><span m=''257290''>Thus,
  the conditional probability is 1 out of 4.</span> </p><p><span m=''262320''>Notice
  that the probability of picking a blue marble given that the marble came from Bowl</span>
  <span m=''267160''>A is NOT equal to the probability that the marble came from Bowl
  A given that the marble</span> <span m=''273030''>was blue. Each has a different
  condition, so be careful not to mix them up!</span> </p><p><span m=''282919''>We''ve
  seen how tables can help us organize our data and visualize changes in the sample</span>
  <span m=''287650''>space.</span> </p><p><span m=''289060''>Let''s look at another
  tool that is useful for understanding conditional probabilities</span> <span m=''293180''>-
  a tree diagram.</span> </p><p><span m=''295870''>Suppose we have a jar containing
  5 marbles; 2 are blue and 3 are yellow. If we draw any</span> <span m=''303220''>one
  marble at random, the probability of drawing a blue marble is 2/5.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''308280''>Now, without replacing the first marble, draw a second marble from
  the jar. Given that the</span> <span m=''314280''>first marble is blue, is the probability
  of drawing a second blue marble still 2/5?</span> </p><p><span m=''320330''>NO,
  it isn''t. Our sample space has changed. If a blue marble is drawn first, you are
  left</span> <span m=''327250''>with 4 marbles; 1 blue and 3 yellow.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''331569''>In other words, if a blue marble is selected first, the probability
  that you draw blue</span> <span m=''336130''>second is 1/4. And the probability
  you draw yellow second is 3/4.</span> </p><p><span m=''342580''>Now pause the video
  and determine the probabilities if the yellow marble is selected first instead.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''354659''>If a yellow marble is selected first, you are left with
  2 yellow and 2 blue marbles.</span> </p><p><span m=''360539''>There is now a 2/4
  chance of drawing a blue marble and a 2/4 chance of drawing a yellow</span> <span
  m=''366389''>marble.</span> </p><p><span m=''368060''>What we have drawn here is
  called a tree diagram. The probability assigned to the second branch</span> <span
  m=''378550''>denotes the conditional probability given that the first happened.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''381660''>Tree diagrams help us to visualize our sample space and
  reason out probabilities.</span> </p><p><span m=''383139''>We can answer questions
  like "What is the probability of drawing 2 blue marbles in a</span> <span m=''387500''>row?"
  In other words, what is the probability of drawing a blue marble first AND a blue</span>
  <span m=''392550''>marble second?</span> </p><p><span m=''394479''>This event is
  represented by these two branches in the tree diagram.</span> </p><p><span m=''399880''>We
  have a 2/5 chance followed by a 1/4 chance. We multiply these to get 2/20, or 1/10.
  The</span> <span m=''408849''>probability of drawing two blue marbles in a row is
  1/10.</span> </p><p><span m=''413349''>Now you do it. Use the tree diagram to calculate
  the probabilities of the other possibilities:</span> <span m=''418729''>blue, yellow;
  yellow, blue; and yellow, yellow.</span> </p><p><span m=''430050''>The probabilities
  each work out to 3/10. The four probabilities add up to a total of 1,</span> <span
  m=''436750''>as they should.</span> </p><p><span m=''438800''>What if we don''t
  care about the first marble? We just want to determine the probability</span> <span
  m=''442599''>that the second marble is yellow.</span> </p><p><span m=''446330''>Because
  it does not matter whether the first marble is blue or yellow, we consider both</span>
  <span m=''450699''>the blue, yellow, and the yellow, yellow paths. Adding the probabilities
  gives us 3/10 + 3/10,</span> <span m=''458099''>which works out to 3/5.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''461139''>Here''s another interesting question. What is the probability that
  the first marble drawn</span> <span m=''465190''>is blue, given that the second
  marble drawn is yellow?</span> </p><p><span m=''468819''>Intuitively, this seems
  tricky. Pause the video and reason through the probability tree</span> <span m=''474050''>with
  a friend.</span> </p><p><span m=''481370''>Because we are conditioning on the event
  that the second marble drawn is yellow, our sample</span> <span m=''485680''>space
  is restricted to these two paths: P(blue, yellow) and P(yellow, yellow).</span>
  </p><p><span m=''489289''>Of these two paths, only the top one meets our criteria
  - that the blue marble is drawn</span> <span m=''494690''>first.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''496759''>We represent the probability as a fraction of favorable to possible
  outcomes. Hence,</span> <span m=''501919''>the probability that the first marble
  drawn is blue, given that the second marble drawn</span> <span m=''506199''>is yellow
  is 3/10 divided by (3/10 +3/10), which works out to 1/2.</span> </p><p><span m=''513450''>I
  hope you appreciate that tree diagrams and tables make these types of probability
  problems</span> <span m=''519000''>doable without having to memorize any formulas!</span>
  </p><p><span m=''527210''>Let''s return to our opening question. Recall that you''ve
  tested positive for a cancer that</span> <span m=''531830''>afflicts 1 out of 1000
  people, based on a test that is 99% accurate.</span> </p><p><span m=''536780''>More
  precisely, out of 100 test results, we expect about 99 correct results and only
  1</span> <span m=''542950''>incorrect result.</span> </p><p><span m=''545100''>Since
  the test is highly accurate, you might conclude that the test is unlikely to be
  wrong,</span> <span m=''550290''>and that you most likely have cancer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''553110''>But wait! Let''s first use conditional probability to make sense of
  our seemingly gloomy diagnosis.</span> </p><p><span m=''559320''>Now pause the video
  and determine the probability that you have the cancer, given that you test</span>
  <span m=''560850''>positive.</span> </p><p><span m=''560940''>Let''s use a tree
  diagram to help with our calculations.</span> </p><p><span m=''564470''>The first
  branch of the tree represents the likelihood of cancer in the general population.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''570650''>The probability of having the rare cancer is 1 in 1000,
  or 0.001. The probability of</span> <span m=''576910''>having no cancer is 0.999.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''581790''>Let''s extend the tree diagram to illustrate the possible
  results of the medical test that</span> <span m=''586260''>is 99% accurate.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''589020''>In the cancer population, 99% will test positive (correctly),
  but 1% will test negative (incorrectly).</span> </p><p><span m=''597150''>These
  incorrect results are called false negatives.</span> </p><p><span m=''601200''>In
  the cancer-free population, 99% will test negative (correctly), but 1% will test
  positive</span> <span m=''607520''>(incorrectly). These incorrect results are called
  false positives.</span> </p><p><span m=''613590''>Given that you test positive,
  our sample space is now restricted to only the population that</span> <span m=''619270''>test
  positive. This is represented by these two paths.</span> </p><p><span m=''624920''>The
  top path shows the probability you have the cancer AND test positive. The lower
  path</span> <span m=''630760''>shows the probability that you don''t have cancer
  AND still test positive.</span> </p><p><span m=''637440''>The probability that you
  actually do have the cancer, given that you test positive, is (0.001*0.99)/((0.001*0.99)+(0.999*0.01)),</span>
  <span m=''655720''>which works out to about 0.09 - less than 10%!</span> </p><p><span
  m=''661150''>The error rate of the test is only 1 percent, but the chance of a misdiagnosis
  is more than</span> <span m=''666880''>90%! Chances are pretty good that you do
  not actually have cancer, despite the rather accurate</span> <span m=''673550''>test.
  Why is this so?</span> </p><p><span m=''676760''>The accuracy of the test actually
  reflects the conditional probability that one tests</span> <span m=''682440''>positive,
  given that one has cancer.</span> </p><p><span m=''685070''>But in practice, what
  you want to know is the conditional probability that you have</span> <span m=''690520''>cancer,
  given that you test positive! These probabilities are NOT the same!</span> </p><p><span
  m=''697520''>Whenever we take medical tests, or perform experiments, it is important
  to understand</span> <span m=''702550''>what events our results are conditioned
  on, and how that might affect the accuracy of</span> <span m=''707260''>our conclusions.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''713180''>In this video, you''ve seen that conditional probability
  must be used to understand and</span> <span m=''717180''>predict the outcomes of
  many events. You''ve also learned to evaluate and manage conditional</span> <span
  m=''722810''>probabilities using tables and trees.</span> </p><p><span m=''726830''>We
  hope that you will now think more carefully about the probabilities you encounter,
  and</span> <span m=''731310''>consider how conditioning affects their interpretation.</span>
