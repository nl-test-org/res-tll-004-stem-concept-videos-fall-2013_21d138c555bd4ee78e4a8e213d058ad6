  to explain the structure of Fick's law. Finally, Fick's Law is used to explain why
  wearing a coat is useful in the winter, to estimate diffusion times for biomolecules,
  and to understand why we need a circulatory system to efficiently transport oxygen
  throughout the body.</p><h2 class="subhead">Learning Objectives</h2><p>After watching

title: Diffusion and Fick's Law
transcript: "<p><span m='5260'> How do neurons send chemical signals to neighboring\
  \ neurons? Why do you wear a jacket in the winter?</span> <span m='11580'>Why do\
  \ some animals have circulatory systems? These questions depend on random walks\
  \ and</span> <span m='17270'>diffusion.</span> <span m='18450'>In this video, using\
  \ a very simple model, you will learn the fundamental difference</span> <span m='22880'>between\
  \ a regular and a random walk, and be able to predict the consequences of that difference</span>\
  \ <span m='28029'>for biophysical systems.</span> <span m='29720'>This video is\
  \ part of the Probability and Statistics video series.</span> <span m='34120'>Many\
  \ events and phenomena are probabilistic. Engineers, designers, and architects often</span>\
  \ <span m='39559'>use probability distributions to predict system behavior.</span>\
  \ <span m='42790'>Hi, my name is Sanjoy Mahajan, and I'm a professor of Applied\
  \ Science and Engineering at Olin</span> <span m='48479'>College.</span> <span m='49690'>Before\
  \ watching this video, you should be familiar with moments of distributions and</span>\
  \ <span m='53960'>with concentration gradients.</span> <span m='56010'>After watching\
  \ this video, you will be able to:</span> <span m='58790'>Describe the difference\
  \ between regular and random walks.</span> <span m='61659'>And, explain the structure\
  \ of Fick's law for flux.</span> <span m='70230'>Between neurons, molecules travel\
  \ by diffusion. They wander a bit, collide, change directions,</span> <span m='75650'>wander\
  \ back, collide again, and higgle and jiggle their way across the neural gap (the</span>\
  \ <span m='79980'>synaptic cleft).</span> <span m='81350'>Here is a diagram of it.\
  \ This is the inside of one neuron, here is the inside of the other</span> <span\
  \ m='86550'>neuron, and here is the synaptic cleft in which there are molecules\
  \ wandering across</span> <span m='91039'>from the left neuron to the right where\
  \ they are received and picked up and used to generate</span> <span m='95300'>a\
  \ signal in the second neuron.</span> <span m='97800'>An extremely simple model\
  \ of this process, which has the merit of containing all the</span> <span m='102080'>essential\
  \ physics, is a molecule making a random walk on a one-dimensional number line:</span>\
  \ <span m='107340'>To further simplify our life, this model molecule moves only\
  \ at every clock tick, and sits peacefully</span> <span m='113780'>waiting for the\
  \ clock tick. At each clock tick, it moves left or right by one unit,</span> <span\
  \ m='118810'>with equal probability (50 percent) of moving in each direction.</span>\
  \ <span m='123170'>Our molecule here, after a few ticks, has reached x=4. So the\
  \ probability of finding</span> <span m='128970'>it at x=4 is 1. What will happen\
  \ to it in the next time ticks? After the next tick,</span> <span m='137060'>the\
  \ molecule is equally likely to be at 3 or 5. That changes the probability distribution</span>\
  \ <span m='142849'>to the following.</span> <span m='144180'>Thus, although we don't\
  \ know exactly where it will be, we know that the expected value</span> <span m='149019'>of\
  \ x is still 4.</span> <span m='153209'>Pause the video here, and find the expected\
  \ value after one more tick -- that is, two</span> <span m='158060'>ticks after\
  \ it was known to be at 4.</span> <span m='167279'>You should have found that the\
  \ expected value is still 4. Here is the probability distribution.</span> <span\
  \ m='173389'>It has a one-fourth chance to be at 2, a one-half chance to be at 4,\
  \ and a one-fourth chance</span> <span m='179279'>to be at 6.</span> <span m='180519'>Thus,\
  \ the expected value of x is \xBC times 2 + \xBD times 4 + \xBC times 6, which equals</span>\
  \ <span m='188989'>4. In short, the expected value never changes. Alone, it is thus\
  \ not a good way of characterizing</span> <span m='197019'>how the molecule wanders.\
  \ We also need to characterize the spread in its position.</span> <span m='202730'>Thus,\
  \ we use a higher moment, the second moment, the expected value of x-squared. At\
  \ first</span> <span m='210340'>when the molecule was at x=4 right here, and it\
  \ was for sure there, then the expected value</span> <span m='216168'>of x^2 was\
  \ just 4^2 or 16.</span> <span m='219819'>What about after one clock tick? Pause\
  \ the video here and work out</span> <span m='234668'>You should have found that</span>\
  \ <span m='256720'>We find that the expected value of x-squared equals 18.</span>\
  \ <span m='259918'>Hmm, it seems like the expected value increases by 1 with every\
  \ clock tick. That's true in</span> <span m='266880'>general, no matter how many\
  \ ticks you wait, or where the molecule started. Thus, for a</span> <span m='272950'>molecule\
  \ starting at the origin (at 0), the expected value of x-squared is just the number</span>\
  \ <span m='277909'>of clock ticks. This equality is fascinating, because it contains</span>\
  \ <span m='283370'>the difference between this kind of walk, a random walk, and\
  \ a regular walk. If the</span> <span m='289030'>molecule did a regular walk, moving\
  \ one step every clock tick, without switching directions,</span> <span m='294250'>then\
  \ the number of clock ticks would be the expected value of x, not x^2.</span> <span\
  \ m='300100'>The random walk is fundamentally different, and that fundamental difference\
  \ will explain,</span> <span m='305060'>among a vast number of physical phenomena,\
  \ why you wear a jacket in the winter, and why</span> <span m='310120'>some animals\
  \ have circulatory systems.</span> <span m='313260'>Now, instead of speaking of\
  \ counting clock ticks, let's measure actual time. Instead</span> <span m='319420'>of\
  \ counting units left or right, let's measure actual distance. If each clock tick\
  \ takes</span> <span m='326570'>time tau, and each distance unit is lambda, instead\
  \ of one, as before, then these relationships</span> <span m='332860'>here change\
  \ slightly to include the dimensions and units. For the regular walk, x is lambda</span>\
  \ <span m='338810'>times the number of ticks. The number of clock ticks is t/tau,\
  \ so the expected value of x</span> <span m='345280'>squared is lambda squared times\
  \ t/Tau here. And here we have lambda times T/Tau for the</span> <span m='351900'>regular\
  \ walk.</span> <span m='354230'>In the regular walk we can rewrite that as Lambda/Tau\
  \ times T. That lambda/tau here has</span> <span m='360650'>a special name: the\
  \ speed. In a random walk, the constant of proportionality is lambda^2/tau.</span>\
  \ <span m='368860'>This constant lambda squared/Tau, which has dimensions of length\
  \ squared/time, is the</span> <span m='374240'>diffusion constant D.</span> <span\
  \ m='376990'>Let's see how \"fast\" a random walk goes, in comparison with a regular\
  \ walk.</span> <span m='382400'>Suppose that the molecule has to cross the narrow\
  \ gap between two neurons, a synaptic</span> <span m='386750'>cleft, which has width\
  \ L. If we wait long enough, until</span> <span m='398100'>How long do we wait on\
  \ average? Until \"t\" here is about L^2 / D. Thus, the \"speed\" of</span> <span\
  \ m='405100'>the random walk is something like the distance divided by this time\
  \ t, and that time t is</span> <span m='410680'>the distance squared divided by\
  \ the diffusion constant. So this speed is the diffusion constant</span> <span m='415659'>divided\
  \ by distance.</span> <span m='417790'>Again we see the fundamental difference between\
  \ a regular and a random walk. A regular walk</span> <span m='423170'>has a constant\
  \ speed here of lambda over tau, as long as lambda and tau don't change. In</span>\
  \ <span m='429320'>contrast, in a random walk, the speed is inversely proportional\
  \ to the gap L.</span> <span m='440240'>This result explains the structure of Fick's\
  \ Law for the flux of stuff. Flux is particles</span> <span m='446050'>per area\
  \ per time. Flux, say's Fick's law, equals the diffusion</span> <span m='450640'>constant\
  \ times the concentration gradient dn/dx, where n is the concentration.</span> <span\
  \ m='456450'>How are the flux and diffusion velocity connected?</span> <span m='460150'>Well\
  \ flux is also equal to the concentration n times the speed. And here the speed\
  \ is D/L.</span> <span m='468120'>But where did the dx here and the dn here come\
  \ from? What do those have to do with n</span> <span m='473720'>and L?</span> <span\
  \ m='475550'>Imagine two regions. One with concentration n1 and another with concentration\
  \ n2, separated</span> <span m='482110'>by a distance delta x.</span> <span m='484480'>So\
  \ this is the concentration of neurotransmitter here at one end and concentration\
  \ of neurotransmitter</span> <span m='489930'>here at the other end of say, a gap.\
  \ We could use this same model for oxygen in a circulatory</span> <span m='495870'>system.</span>\
  \ <span m='497580'>Then the flux in one direction is this and in the reverse direction,\
  \ it's this. The net</span> <span m='503430'>flux is n2-n1 times D/delta x.</span>\
  \ <span m='508360'>So we've explained the d and the delta x in Fick's law over here.\
  \ What about the dn? Well</span> <span m='514979'>n2-n1 is the difference in n,\
  \ or just dn, so this piece here is dn. This is dx, and</span> <span m='522110'>this\
  \ is D.</span> <span m='522760'>So we arrive at Fick's Law based on the realization\
  \ that flux is concentration times speed, and</span> <span m='529320'>the speed\
  \ here in a random walk is the diffusion constant divided by L. And that's why you</span>\
  \ <span m='535029'>wear a coat, rather than a thin shirt, in the winter. The thin\
  \ shirt has a dx of maybe</span> <span m='540700'>2 mm. But the winter coat may\
  \ be 2 cm thick.</span> <span m='545420'>That reduces the heat flux by a factor\
  \ of 10 through your coat compared to the shirt.</span> <span m='550450'>And you\
  \ can stay warm just using the heat produced by your basal metabolism -- about</span>\
  \ <span m='555040'>100 Watts.</span> <span m='556950'>For our final calculations,\
  \ let's return to the neurotransmitter and then discuss circulatory</span> <span\
  \ m='561640'>systems.</span> <span m='562920'>How long would it take a neurotransmitter\
  \ molecule to diffuse across a 20 nm synaptic</span> <span m='567370'>cleft? The\
  \ diffusion constant for a typical neurotransmitter molecule wandering in water,</span>\
  \ <span m='573260'>which is mostly what's in between neurons, is about 10^-10 m^2/s.</span>\
  \ <span m='579340'>Pause the video here and make your estimate of the time.</span>\
  \ <span m='589330'>You should have found that the time is about 4 microseconds.</span>\
  \ <span m='593370'>Is that time short or long? It's short, because it's much smaller\
  \ than, say, the rise time</span> <span m='598690'>of a nerve signal or the timing\
  \ accuracy of nerve signals. Over the short distance of</span> <span m='604260'>the\
  \ synaptic cleft, diffusion is a fast and efficient way to transport molecules.</span>\
  \ <span m='610430'>How does this analysis apply to a circulatory system? Imagine\
  \ a big organism, say you or</span> <span m='615980'>me, but without a circulatory\
  \ system.</span> <span m='618520'>How long would oxygen need to diffuse from the\
  \ lung to a leg muscle say, one meter away?</span> <span m='623960'>That's where\
  \ the oxygen is needed to burn glucose and produce energy. Oxygen, a small</span>\
  \ <span m='629550'>molecule, has a slightly higher diffusion constant than a neurotransmitter\
  \ molecule</span> <span m='633400'>does--D is roughly 1x10^-9 meters squared/sec.</span>\
  \ <span m='638560'>Pause the video and make your estimate of the diffusion time.</span>\
  \ <span m='648490'>You should have found that the diffusion time is roughly...10\
  \ to the ninth seconds!</span> <span m='653580'>That's roughly 30 years! Over long\
  \ distances, diffusion is a lousy method of transport!</span> <span m='660670'>That's\
  \ why we need a circulatory system. Using a dense network of capillaries, the circulatory</span>\
  \ <span m='666089'>system brings oxygen-rich blood near every cell...and only then,\
  \ when the remaining distance</span> <span m='671680'>is tiny, does it let diffusion\
  \ finish the job!</span> <span m='680120'>In this video, we saw how a random walk,\
  \ which is the process underlying diffusion, is fundamentally</span> <span m='685720'>different\
  \ from a regular walk, and how that difference explains the structure of Fick's</span>\
  \ <span m='690210'>law and allows us to estimate diffusion times.</span> <span m='694120'>The\
  \ moral is that we live and breathe based on the random walk, whose physics we can\
  \ understand</span> <span m='699790'>with a simple number line and moments of distributions.</span>\
