Four scenarios are presented wherein the heat transfer between a pan and its handle, and between the handle and the room are constrained in a variety of ways, and the resultant temperature profiles are discussed. Viewers are asked to: determine whether the handle is at thermal equilibrium or steady state temperature; sketch a corresponding temperature profile in the pan-handle; and predict whether or not a particular pan-handle will be cool enough to touch. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Identify whether a system is at equilibrium and/or steady state. Describe the differences and similarities between equilibrium and steady state.

Entropy is introduced as a natural variable whose derivative with respect to energy is zero when the number of microstates is maximized. This derivative is identified as being the reciprocal of temperature, and Boltzmann’s constant is explained. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to explain how the definition of temperature arises as a derivative of entropy with respect to energy.

Lego ® molecules are used to visualize the ideas that reactions are reversible, reaction rates change with time, and at equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. Learning Objectives After watching this video students will be able to: Understand how reaction rate is influenced by reactant concentration. Explain how reaction rates change as a system establishes equilibrium. Predict relative equilibrium concentrations of reactant and product, based on rates of forward and reverse processes.
